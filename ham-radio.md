## Glossary

- [**CW**](http://www.arrl.org/cw-mode): Continuous wave.

- Be nice to first timers on the air.
- You can find your own address on [this page](https://apc-cap.ic.gc.ca/pls/apc_anon/query_amat_cs$.startup). Take it off there so no one robs you.

## Electronics

## Antennas

- Antenna traps "cut" the antenna so the place where you put the trap will cause the antenna to "not be there".
- A balun is an impedance transformer, to match two transmission lines of different impedances. You can flip a 6:1 balun to get a 1:6 balun.
