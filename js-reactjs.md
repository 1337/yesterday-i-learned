- [React man](https://youtu.be/mVVNJKv9esE?t=20m54s) admits that it is not their proudest moment to place HTML in JavaScript, but a _concession_ because templates, as a form of data, [although fast] can no longer meet the flexibility needs of code. Turning data into code is a form of abstraction, which prevents optimisation. Man also noted that Ember limits itself to data templates, which are indeed optimisable and are therefore faster.
- In a default `create-react-app` project (or any webpack project, right?), [you literally `import 'a_css_file.css';` in your `index.js` file](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) to have it bundled, and it is presumed that webpack knows where `node_modules` is.
- React is [the most flexible](https://medium.com/@TechMagic/reactjs-vs-angular5-vs-vue-js-what-to-choose-in-2018-b91e028fa91d), and therefore, the easiest to get wrong, among Angular2+, React, and Vue.
- Events like `onClick` accept handlers whose `this` is the class, so either of these will work: `onClick={this.classMethod.bind(this)}` (where `classMethod() {...}`), or `onClick={this.instanceMethod} (where`instanceMethod = () {...}`).
- In a `.jsx` file, any method can return JSX.
- Component tag names need to start with a capital letter.
- [MobX 5.x](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx#browser-support) dropped support for any browser that doesn't have [ES6 proxies](https://caniuse.com/#search=proxy).
- In the past, every component has at most one root element in the JSX. As of 2018---I think whenever [React Fiber](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html) came out---[you can wrap your stuff with `<React.Fragment> ... </React.Fragment>`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZbTqEmQpDo), which is basically a no-root-element placeholder, or, if you use Babel 7 and above, you can get a react plugin to use the shorthand syntax `<> ... </>`, which does the exact same thing.
- Events are not bound to an instance of the class, so if an event (say `onClick`) handler has `onClick={this.method}`, the `method` inside your component must be `method = () => { ... }` rather than the usual `method() { ... }`. You can alternatively [have `this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)` in the constructor for every single event](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/).
- [First `state`... then `props`... now `context`...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLJN4JfniH4) `React.createContext` is a semi-global object provided by a "<xyz.Provider> ... </xyz.Provider>" that is also a subclass of a `Component`. You then wrap your anything (including your root app component) with that `<.Provider>`, and all children can access that same `context` (an anonymous function) in anything you wrap inside `<.Context.Consumer>`. More caveats in the video.
- React "Fiber" (16 and up) allows animations to [not stop](https://build-mbfootjxoo.now.sh/) while other elements are rendering.
- [Input elements cannot update react's state unless you give them an `onChange`](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#why-textarea-value). If you really just want to be able to type in a box and not care about the state, you can tell react to shut the fuck up with `onChange={this.noop}`.
