# [Looking for a suitable investment class](http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/financial-planning/investments/investing-101-how-to-beat-inflation-1.1674984)

## Terms

- AUR: average user retention
- Board Lot: a unit for "number of shares" in your stock exchange. Typically, A lot is 100 shares. Because trading 100 shares is easier than trading 17 shares, trading is often done in lots.
- Book value: the "net asset value" of the company. A company's stock can (intrinsically) cost $5, but be traded at $300 because people love to speculate.
- Buy on Stop: buy, when the price hits the value you specified.
- Div yield (%): total dividend per year per share
- EPS: earnings per share
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence): The MACD is calculated by simply subtracting a 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the closing prices from a 12-period EMA. The signal line is a nine-period exponential moving average of the MACD.
- ROI (Return on investment): (Income - taxes) last year, divided by the debts. Higher is better.
- S&P500 (Standard & Poor's 500): stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ"
- [Underwriters](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp): they determine the offering price of a stock (whether initial aka IPO or when the company is bought out), and then get some underwriting fee for doing it. That price determined affect how the rest of the market prices the remaining stock. Say if you trade at $8 but the [bought deal](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boughtdeal.asp) offers each share at $7, then the market might adjust to \$7.
- p.s. "bought deal" means someone buys all available shares.
- [Slippage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. However, [beta slippage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) is something else; it refers to the difference between "going down 10% and then back up by 10%", which, unfortunately, does not add up to 1.
- ["Consider various strategies alternatives available to the company." means "sell, sell, sell."](http://www.fool.ca/2016/06/03/why-did-concordia-healthcare-corp-drop-over-20-yesterday/)
- A [Full Gap Up](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:gap_trading_strategies#full_gap_upshort) occurs when the opening price is greater than yesterday's high price.
- A Full Gap Down occurs when the opening price is less than yesterday's low.
- A Partial Gap Up occurs when today's opening price is higher than yesterday's close, but not higher than yesterday's high.
- A Partial Gap Down occurs when the opening price is below yesterday's close, but not below yesterday's low.

## Cash

Holding cash under your mattress has low volatility, no [risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/32kd0x/whether_youre_new_to_trading_or_notlean_on_these/) (other than getting it stolen), and has incomparable purchasing power. Never beats inflation.

With cash, you are not investing.

## Savings account

If your savings account has an interest rate above 0%, you start getting money for the amount you save. But if this rate is below inflation, you still lose purchasing power over time.

At an annual interest rate of 2%, it takes 350 years to turn a dollar into a thousand dollars (or a hundred dollars in two hundred and thirty four years).

[Negative interest rates](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/what-are-negative-interest-rates-explainer/) come from the central bank. Other banks keep their money with the central bank to get interest from it. By imposing a negative interest rate, the central bank penalises other banks for storing money instead of lending it out, which means other banks would be inclined to lend and boost the economy. (In 2019) [Denmark's Jyske Bank offers borrowers 0.5% bonus to take out a mortgage](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/danish-bank-is-offering-10-year-mortgages-with-negative-interest-rates.html). This happens when they worry about where the markets are headed... for example, if they think lending people money would jumpstart their economy, or if they think those borrowers won't be able to pay off a loan later.

In a scenario where overnight interest rates are [negative](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/what-are-negative-interest-rates-explainer/), it is possible for saving money in the bank to _cost_ money. As a result, people are inclined to invest money elsewhere, which means the money is being used in the economy.

## Bonds

Issued by the government, bonds have low volatility, low risk, and low return. [Sometimes the return won't even be positive](https://www.ft.com/content/2ae4237a-2d3e-33dd-b9e0-120c4a93a29c).
Bonds values do not correlate to stock market performance, so when the stock market is doing poorly, bonds might lose less than stocks do.

Since bonds are sold in large quantities, you typically don't buy stocks directly. Buy mutual funds or ETFs that invest in bonds instead.

## Futures

[Future contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract) are obligations to buy or sell something on predetermined dates. So, if you think ("speculate") the price of oil will go up in a year (say from $10 to $100), you can always [buy oil now](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/started-futures-trading/) (say at \$20) to lock in that price.

If you don't need oil, you can also sell your contract, which was locked in at a lower price (say $20), to someone else, who wants to buy it for a higher price (say $50) because the price of oil is even higher now (say $100). Now you earn $30 by selling a contract but not the oil.

## Equity ("stocks")

At the cost of high volatility, equity provides the highest return, provided that you pick the right stocks and get the timing right.

To give you an idea how risky stocks are, an overwhelming number of people suggest buying mutual funds instead of [trying to be clever](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets).

- "Don't pick stocks" - [wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/5rules) (low MER index funds are good enough for most people)
- "DON'T PICK STOCKS" - Motley Fool podcast. 40% of companies on the stock exchange end up going out of business.
- Invest in a company only if you have a good answer for "why are you investing in this particular company?"
- If you don't expect a stock to outperform an index fund---which has far less risk---don't buy the stock. Actually, if you don't expect a stock to be able to beat the market at all, don't buy any stocks. You aren't cut out for stocks.
- Never spend all your money on stocks.

### Shorting

["Shorting" stocks](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/shorting-stocks.html) involves you borrowing your broker's stocks, buying your copy of these stocks at a lower price, and giving back these stocks to your broker. You end up with these stocks, and the price difference. [There is no limit to how much money you can lose while short selling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMqZR3pqMjg), at least in the sense that you can lose more than what you put into the market. You can lose $900 on $100 worth of stocks if the price goes up 9x.

Similarly, [Margins](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/dangerous-moves-first-time-investors.asp?no_header_alt=true) involve borrowing money to buy stocks that (you hope it will) go up.

> Take this example – you have $100 and borrow $50 to buy $150 of a stock. If the stock rises 10% ($165), you make $15, or a 15% return on your capital. But, if the stock declines 10% ($135), you lose $15, or a 15% loss. More importantly, if the stock goes up by 50% ($225), you make 75% return. But, if the stock declines 50% (\$75), you lose all your money!

### Looking for a suitable company

- Read the company's _annual report_, _Standard & Poor's Stock Report_ (See S&P500), and WSJ.
- _Earnings_, _earnings growth_, and _return on equity (ROE)_ should be 10% higher than the year before.
- _Sales_ and _Equity_ (if present) should be higher than the year before.
- _Debt_ should be less than half of the company's _assets_.
- The stock's _price-to-earnings ratio_ should be between 20 and 40. [Generally speaking, having a high P/E ratio means that investors like you and believe that you have a bright future](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/05/the-new-fast-food/), but [too high of a P/E ratio means that the stock is overvalued.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/092200.asp)
  - [Different industries have different acceptable P/E ratios.](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/stock-lower-pe-always-better-choice/) when comparing P/E ratios, only do so for companies in the same industry.
- The stock's _price-to-sales ratio_ should be close to 1.
- Avoid stocks you find on the news (for they become unstable), "the next big thing" companies, and companies that diversify through acquisition instead of innovation.

[You should also like what the company does](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5rsnr5/what_is_the_most_important_research_before_buying/dd9v416/):

- Sales growth of at least 10% over the past year.
- Low debt
- High quality management with a good track record and unquestionable integrity
- Leading market position or a dominant player in a niche market
- Positive operating cash flow
- High insider ownership
- Competitive advantage of some sort, something that prevents or makes it hard for competition to enter

### Looking for a generic trade

- Buy gold when the market is stable. Since gold has inherent value, gold is often bought by others when the market is unstable, which is the time you should sell.
- Buy bonds when stocks are falling. (More research required)
- Consider things that people *need* when stocks are falling. Examples: waste management, education, essential medicine manufacturing, cigarettes, and discount retailers.


### Looking for a suitable time

Further reading: [0001.md](sources/0001.md)

- [Buy the rumour sell the news](http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/buy-on-the-rumor-sell-on-the-news-vod-vz-t-aapl-goog0706.aspx): traders typically dump shares immediately after a new product is introduced. You should therefore buy the shares somewhere around two weeks after the release, and sell a week before the hype cycle comes to a close.
- Don't try to "time the market" (predicting its movements and buying and selling accordingly). You may get lucky, but will not succeed over the long term.

#### To buy

You can get as technical (with charts and graphs and trend indicators) as you want, but you will never beat the fundamentals. **Do not time the market.**

- Consider buying stocks in a _bull market_: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing. A [bullmarket.co](http://bullmarkets.co/model/) offers a number from 0 to 100 on whether the market is bullish or bearish.
- Never buy stocks in a _bear market_: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic. (after the fall is done, it is not called the bear market anymore.)
- It doesn't hurt to buy stocks _after_ it is done dropping. Buying before it's done dropping is called "catching a falling knife".
- Johnson says that if you miss the top 10 days of equity market growth in a year you miss 90 percent of returns.
- [When VIX is low its time to go; When VIX is high its time to buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/3dqggo/when_vix_is_low_its_time_to_go_when_vix_is_high)
- [Relative Strength Index, RSI](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) should be under 50. 100 means the stock is extremely overbought. 0 means the stock is extremely [oversold](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp). See [stockcharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/) for visuals. Be careful with the index, as modifying its calculation period can switch the results completely. "Oversold" may also just mean the stock is doing very poorly, instead of a bargain indicator.
- [Stochastic Oscillator](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full) is like RSI, except it comes in three versions: %K (fast), %D (3-day moving average), and full (X-day moving average).
- "The best way to use RSI is to watch and wait for it to enter a zone and then for the %K to cross the %D in the opposite direction. That tends to be a signal that the stock is going to reverse its trend and is a great time to buy or sell."
- The stock's [beta](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) should be less than 1 (i.e. less volatile than the market). a Beta of 0.6 means the thing is 40% less volatile than the market. "Many utilities stocks have a beta of less than 1." "Negative betas are possible for investments that tend to go down when the market goes up."
- "Buy low sell high" is great, but [do not let world events affect your investing decisions](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/03/warren-buffetts-5-key-investing-donts.html). During e.g. a war, stocks continue to go up. It is more worthwhile to hold onto securities (assets) than cash.
- In August. "October is known for bringing the highest shifts in volatility for a couple of reasons: third-quarter earnings season kicks off early October, and trading volume is significantly higher after the calm summer months." [Coca-cola](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/) is almost cyclical in that you would have never lost money if you buy in August and sell in January.
- A "buy" [limit order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) can be used to trigger a buy when a stock dips below a certain price.
- Inflation favours banks (somehow). So, buy bank stocks when [the idiot](https://forwardprogressives.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/trump-idiot-1.jpg) does anything that encourages inflation.
- You can buy before or after the [ex-dividend date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp) (after which the shares will drop in price, because they won't be paid dividends). You just need to know that. If you buy before the date, you should pay no more than the value of the stock % dividend percentage.

#### [To sell](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/5-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stock.aspx)

(Also called 套現, or "cash out")

- When the price is right (hits your target). [Do not be greedy.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/learn-loss.asp)
- When the price is too low (where you lose too much).
- When the company is no longer doing its business the right way or making enough sales
- When a better stock exists
- When the company is acquired
- When the company goes bankrupt (selling it doesn't give you money, but you can claim it as capital loss)
- [When you anticipate a market failure](http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/53znlq/_/).
- A "sell" [limit order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) can be used to trigger a sell when a stock goes above a certain price.
- [In May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sell_in_May)
- When it is November/December, and the price [went down during the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7b4x2z/end_of_year_selloff/). This can be claimed as investment loss. (Similarly, because you konw people will sell for tax credits, it is not wise to buy stocks in November/December, since they are likely to go down as people sell.)
- ~~In 2019. 2020 is when the last of baby boomers reach the age of 60.~~ (But they don't just sell everything at once, so ignore me.)
- When 10 years is up. That is enough time to guarantee a typical stock to have gone up.
- Never, because you're holding and collecting dividends.
- [Never put yourself in a position where you _need to sell at a certain time_](https://www.thebalance.com/risks-when-selecting-equity-investments-356429). By doing so, you lose the "good stocks trend up after a long enough wait" advantage.
- When the insiders are selling (a lot). Insider stock selling is almost never a good sign. Unless they are retiring or something, why would someone with a good company sell?
- Sell if stocks aren't appreciating (rising in value). They do nothing even if you hold on to them for a long time.

## Mutual Funds

If you want to [leave stock-picking to someone else](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-when-mutual-funds-make-more-sense-than-etfs/), then pick an actively-managed mutual fund, contribute to it monthly, and forget about it. Unlike ETFs, where one trade is typically \$10 through your standard broker, contributions to mutual funds typically have no additional fees.

[Mutual fund orders are executed at 4pm eastern time](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110615/when-are-mutual-fund-orders-executed.asp) (or 4:30pm? That's when the TSX closes). The price is calculated, [roughly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp), the fund's assets - liabilities, divided by the number of shares there is.

[**Dollar cost averaging**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) is a fancy term for "putting $100 into your mutual funds every month when you have $10000". If you don't have the lump sum to begin with, it is called **automatic investing** instead. On one hand, it does reduce risk for when, say, the market crashes shortly after you deposit a lump sum amount. On the other hand, since you didn't put in that lump sum amount, you don't benefit from the gains if the market goes up. So: throw in a lump sum if you have the money _and_ the market is expected to go up. Throw in a invest small amounts regularly otherwise.

- Mutual [Funds of funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_of_funds) do exist. They are figuratively inflation funds. They also have higher MERs.
- [Rebalancing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) your portfolio means, if your funds 1 (33%), 2 (33%), and 3 (33%) grew by (-50%, 0%, 50%), then your portfolio is no longer 1/3 each, and you need to "rebalance" your portfolio such that they are 33% each. If you decide to do so by selling fund 3 rather than putting more money into fund 1, _rebalancing implies selling high and buying low._
- /u/learner1314: [Never pump in money into a mutual fund that has invested more than 95% of its money. Instead look at those who have sat on the sidelines and are cash rich with 20-30% of money sitting idle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5w41k3/warrens_letter/) I believe the reasoning is that funds with some cash leeway can easily overcome a short term market downturn without having to sell existing positions.

## ETFs (Exchange-traded funds)

For [non-actively managed funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-mutual-fund-difference.asp) (e.g. index funds), mutual funds' high MER don't justify themselves. Either get a low-fee mutual fund or an ETF.

They can be bought and sold whenevr the exchange is open, instead of a once-per-night type thing. When you decide to buy/sell, though, do have a bid-ask spread.

ETFs can be traded even when the assets' exchanges are closed. Try not to trade on a holiday where the underlying assets are traded. Don't trade an American ETF on the fourth of July, for example.

[Leveraged ETFs are known for their natural decay. On the long term, holding a position in an N-times leveraged ETF is generally worse than holding an N-times leveraged position in the underlying asset.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) As /u/MasterCookSwag tried to put it simply: "You have $100 invested in dogshit and another $100 in 3x dogshit. Dogshit goes from $100 to $90 back to $100. Thats a loss of 10% then a subsequent gain of 11.11% for a net 0% move. 3x dogshit does, you guessed it, 3x that which means it loses 30% and subsequently gains 33.33%. That's a drop from $100 to $70 then back up to $93. You just lost 7% because of leverage. Voila. You lost money because of resetting leverage."

## Property

Properties (e.g. houses that you don't live in) usually beat inflation in the long term.
However, properties are vulnerable to pricing bubbles.

### Who

* [Shop around for realtor](https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/what-every-first-time-home-buyer-needs-to-know/), and [NOT a real estate agent/broker](https://www.teamrealty.ca/sellers/difference-between-a-realtor-and-real-estate-agent/). The former must adhere to a moral code and undergo training. The latter are [salespeople](https://comparerealestateagents.ca/real-estate-agent-vs-broker/), brokers included. You aren't just assessing the house. You are also assessing the person you trust to choose the house for you, with their rich set of sales data (note: **the more data a realtor has, the better they are**), expertise, and negotiating power.
* Don't get a mortgage from someone who knows your financials (i.e. your bank). They can and _will_ convince you to buy something else to maximise their commission.

### What

* "The golden rule No.1 is never buy [a] new flat _for investment_ ... Investment on used flats do not have problem of sharp depreciation because they have been depreciated when investors bought them ... However, [buying new flats] is consumption but not investment."
* There is _always_ a market for small houses. There will _always_ be young people trying to start their first family. This makes small houses easier to sell, and also in greater demand. Wait, great demand? That means smaller houses will be more expensive than larger houses in terms of worth.
* [RBC suggests](https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/mortgage/campaign/first-time-home-buyer/_assets-custom/includes/23625_Eng.pdf) buying a home where your `(rent + taxes + heating) / monthly income` does not exceed 32%, and where your `(home loan + car loan + credit card loan) / monthly income` does not exceed 40%.

### When

* Property value is linked to to bonds value, and is inversely correlated to the central bank interest rate. [*If the government lowers the central bank interest rate to boost the economy because it has to, it will also lower the bar for people to buy homes, making their prices go higher.*](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/interest-rates-affect-property-values.asp)
* In a bullish market, where you expect the price to go up, buy what you can, sooner rather than later. (Sounds obvious, right? If it's that easy to tell if the price will go up, then the price is always going to go up.)

### Where

* A place with lots of trees nearby, but not necessarily right beside you, can lower air pollution, noise, and chances of flood.
* You won't want a place at an intersection. These places have higher insurance premiums because that's where cars commonly crash.

### How

* It is a misconception that you don't pay fees when you buy your first house. Not so. [You actually pay all the fees](https://youngandthrifty.ca/real-estate-agent-commissions-decoded/) because you aren't selling anything. "These fees are worked in the home’s total purchase price. The buyer is the one who will be paying off those extra thousands of dollars (plus interest) over the next 25 years."


## BitCoin

Never treat BitCoin as an investment. You can gamble all you want, but it is not an investment.

- A security is a tradable financial asset of any kind, but [BitCoin is not a security](https://coincenter.org/link/sec-chairman-clayton-bitcoin-is-not-a-security), perhaps because it falls short on the definition of ["asset"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset), which can be tangible or intangible.
- "The fact that 90% of people use [BitCoin] for speculation rather than as currency is all the proof you need that it's a bubble."
