# Django troubleshooting

## South is being a douche

### `relation_blah_blah_blah already exists`

The table exists, and is not managed by celery. **Delete all tables** to continue.

```
python manage.py flush --no-initial-data --noinput
# do whatever initial schema migrations

# then, "upload the zip", if you know what I'm saying.
# Alternatively,
python manage.py syncdb && python manage.py migrate
```
