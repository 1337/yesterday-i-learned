1. A security is a tradable financial asset of any kind, but [BitCoin is not a security](https://coincenter.org/link/sec-chairman-clayton-bitcoin-is-not-a-security), perhaps because it falls short on the definition of ["asset"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset). Which can be tangible or intangible. Not sure.

1. ["Save 25X your annual spending and you can retire. If you invest to earn 7%/yr (on avg), you can withdraw 4% forever."](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) - Attributed to a comment [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18128477)1.
