1. Investment "Rule of 72"... 72/rate = investment doubles in n years
1. Only a fool would look at fool.com/fool.ca. On the 24th: ["Why Home Capital Group Inc is the Stock of the Year"](http://www.fool.ca/2017/04/24/why-home-capital-group-inc-is-the-stock-of-the-year/). On the 26th: Home Capital Group Inc drops by 60%+.
1. "[Circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy)" is a buzzword that means "nothing in manufacturing goes to waste".
1. "Other people's money" and "Other people's time" are proven ways to make yourself richer. That's why companies exist. That's why you shouldn't be working for others purely for the money.
1. A security is a tradable financial asset of any kind, but [BitCoin is not a security](https://coincenter.org/link/sec-chairman-clayton-bitcoin-is-not-a-security), perhaps because it falls short on the definition of ["asset"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset). Which can be tangible or intangible. Not sure.
1. "Bluechips" are large companies with huge market caps. They are usually safe, and don't move up and down much.
1. ["Save 25X your annual spending and you can retire. If you invest to earn 7%/yr (on avg), you can withdraw 4% forever."](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) - Attributed to a comment [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18128477)1. "Gig economy" means people are always doing short-term work. [40% of jobs are expected to be one of those by 2020.](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/gig-economy)
1. [Nest Egg](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nestegg.asp) means savings (for a purpose).
1. [Credit monitoring a ripoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKnHgsyeS8): that's like hiring a guard that calls you whenever your house was broken into. What you want are credit freezes (assuming you don't want it to get higher, either.)
1. [Candlestick *sharts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) show the same things as OHLC (open-high-low-close) charts. If it's green then it went up during the day, and if it's red then it went down during the day. OHLC because ["open is on the left, close is on the right"](https://static.incrediblecharts.com/images/png_images/bar.png) requires a higher screen resolution, and you cannot see the general trend of whether a period of time is mostly green or red.

RRSPs [work only for people who](https://retirehappy.ca/when-should-you-not-buy-an-rrsp/) a) currently have an income above the marginal, and b) expect their tax bracket to be lower when they are old than what it is now. It also makes sense to [save your contribution room until the market is down](http://www.moneysense.ca/save/retirement/surprising-truths-about-your-rrsp/).
1. /u/learner1314: [Never pump in money into a mutual fund that has invested more than 95% of its money. Instead look at those who have sat on the sidelines and are cash rich with 20-30% of money sitting idle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5w41k3/warrens_letter/) I believe the reasoning is that funds with some cash leeway can easily overcome a short term market downturn without having to sell existing positions.
1. [Rising rates mean lower bond prices (lower yield).](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/what-to-do-with-your-bond-portfolio-as-fed-rates-rise.html)
