- **Sales are proof-of-concept**. Sales are the fact that you can make up your opinion, but you can't make up your own facts. Your opinion is, "I think I have something." **Sales is, "I know I have something."** - Daymond, same kind of shark
- [The average tech guy in Toronto earns \$100k a year](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/careers/article-tech-salary-growth-in-toronto-outpaces-most-global-hubs/). That is lower than global averages.
- A [double-entry bookkeeping system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system) insists that money has to go from one place to another. Every dollar has to come from somewhere, and go somewhere. That way if you try to do "rounding error"-type tricks, one side (either you or the store) will get less money.
- When investing, doing nothing is sometimes, maybe even often, doing the right thing.
- Thinking about profitability is very easy. [If the cost of you acquiring the customer is less than how much the customer will pay you, then you've made a profit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bFFgrLSEXA). Selling bundles is great, because (a) people think they get deals, and (b) people pay monthly, and (c) they rarely use everything in their bundles, which means less operating cost per customer.

- "[Circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy)" is a buzzword that means "nothing in manufacturing goes to waste".

- [Candlestick _sharts_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) show the same things as OHLC (open-high-low-close) charts. If it's green then it went up during the day, and if it's red then it went down during the day. OHLC because ["open is on the left, close is on the right"](https://static.incrediblecharts.com/images/png_images/bar.png) requires a higher screen resolution, and you cannot see the general trend of whether a period of time is mostly green or red.
- RRSPs [work only for people who](https://retirehappy.ca/when-should-you-not-buy-an-rrsp/) a) currently have an income above the marginal, and b) expect their tax bracket to be lower when they are old than what it is now. It also makes sense to [save your contribution room until the market is down](http://www.moneysense.ca/save/retirement/surprising-truths-about-your-rrsp/).

- You can [buy debt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxUAntt1z2c) for a fraction of the actual amount of the debt, in the hopes that the debt will eventually be paid back. This is also why banks sell debt: they don't think the debt will be paid back.

Governments sell negative yield bonds because [(most) insurance companies pension funds have to own bonds, even if the financial return is negative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-bond-yield.asp). They have no choice but to buy at a loss.
- A [hostile bid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostile-bid.asp) is a takeover bid that is similar to a [hostile takeover bid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hostile-takeover-bid.asp)?

- "Drop by 1% everyday" has a lower bound. "Rise by 1% everyday" does not. A 1% drop after a 1% rise results in less than before.
- [Insolvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency) (inability to pay back) happens before you really go bankrupt. Because you can have a house and not \$10 at the same time, you can be very rich and still _cash-flow insolvent_.

- The current monetary system that [some other currencies are worth some other amount in USD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNo7MDN5-0g) was a concept introduced after WWII to stabilise the global economy.

- [Banks sell the ownership of their mortgaged houses all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOv72Awo68). Just because you got your mortgage from bank A, it doesn't mean bank A owns that house a few months later. During the subprime mortgage crisis, lending requirements got more and more lax, making mortgage-backed investments appear more reliable than historical data suggested.
