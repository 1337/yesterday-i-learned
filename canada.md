The money comes directly from the federal government.
- View your newspaper biases from [2019 Canadian federal election party endorsements by media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_federal_election#Endorsements). Toronto Star is liberal. National Post is conservative. No one liked NDP. Le Devoir supported BQ.
- The [Hudson's Bay point blanket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_point_blanket) was traded to First Nations in exchange for beaver pelts.

The Bay even had [its own flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Hudson%27s_Bay_Company) when it was a _de facto_ government. [Their motto](http://www.hbcheritage.ca/faq), _pro pelle cutem_, "skin for leather", was apparently a play on [Job, 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+2%3A4&version=NIV): _Pellem pro pelle_, "skin for skin".
- Elections have federal and provincial [expense limits](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=loi/com/arc/com2017&document=p6&lang=e), some bracketed, some are not; some have limits, some do not.

- [89% of Canada's land is crown land; the other 11% is privately owned.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_ownership_in_Canada) When you "buy" a place or land with that place, you only buy "land tenure" (right to hold the land) in that place. As for the [11% that actually owns private land](https://www.ontariowoodlot.com/publications-and-links/owa-publications/landowner-guides/download/59_77492d55a6aab2093dcf761c0bf49cc5) (pdf), they sell wood.

- [Pension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension) is funded by your employer. [Canada Pension Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Pension_Plan) (CPP) is funded by you... but [you only need to make one contribution to CPP to collect every single pension after that](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-benefit/eligibility.html). So work at least once before you turn 65.
- If no one can have sex in public, and homeless people don't have homes, then it is already illegal for the poor to reproduce (if everyone were perfectly lawful, anyway).
- On the dime is the [Nova Scotian bluenose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluenose#Fame_and_commemoration), a schooner. It was good for fishing and racing.
- "Quebecers" are a [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation) because [a bill in 2006 said so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_nation_motion). This "nation" is not a country but a collection of people, like in "first nations". In Chinese, this translates to either [Ê∞ëÊóè (ethnic/ethnographic group), ÂúãÊóè (actually "nation"), ÊóèÁæ§ (ethnic group), or ‰∫∫Á®Æ (race)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F_%28%E6%B6%88%E6%AD%A7%E7%BE%A9%29).

- TD WebBroker charges you [commission fee for every day an order is open](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/8yca7e/td_webbroker_buy_order_fulfilled_over_several/): "(commission) is paid with each partial fill as at the end of the day. If you have 3 fills in the course of one day, you pay one commission. If you have 3 partial fills over the course of 3 days, you pay 3 separate commissions."
- Dundas and Sherbourne is packed with action. There you once saw someone being tackled by the police from 3m away.

- ["CTV"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network), owned by Bell, has never meant "Canadian television" because [CBC claims to have exclusive rights to the term "Canadian"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network#Early_years).
- ["300,000 Canadians ... call Hong Kong home."](https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2019/08/19/why-are-there-so-many-canadians-in-hong-kong.html) "Most Canadians living in Hong Kong were born in Hong Kong and only lived in Canada for four to five years, according to the foundation‚Äôs report."
- It is ["strongly discouraged, but it is not illegal"](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/sin/protect.html) for private-sector organisations to ask for your SIN, for stuff like looking for a new lease on an apartment or a car.
- [Canadians cannot do a "credit freeze"](https://globalnews.ca/news/5706918/capital-one-breach-new-social-insurance-number-sin/). The concept is American-only. Replacing your SIN does not erase your old one, and any debt incurred by the old one is still going to be paid by you, so getting a new SIN is not useful for fraud protection, and is [not entertained by the government](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/sin/protect.html) unless the SIN has _already_ been used for fraud.
- [Canola oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola_oil#Origin) came from CAN- (Canada) and -OLA (suffix for other oil products). It is a variant of rapeseed oil, so not all rapeseed oil is canola oil, but all canola oil is rapeseed oil.
- [Robin's](http://www.robinsdonuts.com/) call their version of timbits, "Robin's eggs". Dunkin Donuts call them "munchkins". Regardless of brand, they are all donut holes.

- In Ontario, [black on yellow licence plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Ontario) are non-passenger, removable "service plates", for anyone who repairs, customizes, modifies, manufactures or transports motor vehicles.

- In Canada, [you can](https://www.todaysparent.com/family/family-life/myths-about-getting-a-divorce/): cheat and still win a court case, get divorced without signing (with due process), split assets with your gay partner, and move out of the house and still keep it after the divorce. Your properties and pension also get split, usually evenly.
- On [women poking holes in condoms](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13511/index.do) to get themselves pregnant, the supreme court says: it is sexual assault (since it invalidates the partner's consent) but not fraud (since unwanted fatherhood is not serious bodily harm to the man). On [_men_ poking holes in their own condoms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/man-s-refusal-to-wear-condom-after-agreeing-to-cancels-out-consent-judge-1.4492602): it is fraud and sexual assault at the same time.

- [King George V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V) said that [the Canada flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Canada)'s red and white colours were to come from [Saint George's Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Cross), and the French royal emblem, respectively. However, the red on the Saint George's Cross is rgb(207, 8, 31); the red on the [Union Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack), which _has_ the Saint George's Cross in it, is rgb(200, 16, 46); both of which are different from Canada's rgb(255, 0, 0), so Canada didn't actually get the red from Saint George's Cross. There was actually no record of [Saint George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George), a dude born in [present-day Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia), personally using his cross, but the people of [Genoa, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa) made that flag and attributed the design to him, so... it's his flag now.
- If you make about [300 kCAD/year](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/03/14/top-one-per-cent-canada_a_23385825/), you are the top 1%. (Stats Canada says it's 400k, while HuffPost says it's 300k. Either way, since you work for free, you aren't the top 1%.)

- Raptors' NBA win in 2019 was in fact [Canada's first NBA win](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/video-raptors-win-canadas-first-nba-championship/), but not the team that had won from the highest latitude---that was Oregon's [Portland Trail Blazers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/we-the-north-the-raptors-slogan-mocked-by-the-portland-trail-blazers-1.2887500), at lat=45.52.

- Landshark Lager is made by the brick brewery.
- The Waterloo region [can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Ontario#Climate) reach "feels like 50 degrees" during the summer.
- When the region of Waterloo says [we'll help pay 5% of your house](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterloo/comments/b5iooh/has_anyone_used_the_region_of_waterloo_affordable/), they mean they want to have 5% stake in your house. It can be a good thing (if you're poor and just want a place to live) or a bad thing (if you're rich and want to be richer), so this is a very good system.
- VRTUCAR is owned by [Communauto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communauto), a private company headquartered in Montreal. [It is not a co-op](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/vrtucar-communauto-community-careshare-kw-waterloo-hamilton-1.4594729).

- The [spousal support advisory guideline](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/spousal-epoux/ssag-ldfpae.html) is just that: a guideline. It is not law and judges do not have to calculate anything for spousal payments if you get divorced.

- [Around 5000 houses burn down in Ontario every year.](https://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/english/FireMarshal/MediaRelationsandResources/FireStatistics/OntarioFires/FireLossesCausesTrendsIssues/stats_causes.html)
- On why selling sex is legal but buying sex is not: "Basically, more people are willing to buy sex legally than are willing to sell it. A LOT more. So when prostitution is legalized the demand shoots way up but the supply does not. This makes sex trafficking and forced prostitution very profitable. If you look at crime stats for human trafficking before and after prostitution is legalized, human trafficking actually goes up by a lot in countries where prostitution has been legalized. Legalizing selling sex while keeping it illegal to buy solves both problems. It doesn't increase demand, and it makes prostitution safer for everyone involved." - /u/The_Last_Mammoth
- At least according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation#List_of_financial_collapses_since_1967), there has not been a "financial [company] collapse" in Canada since 1996.

For some reason carriers in Mantioba CA use the timezone of America/Resolute instead of America/Winnipeg.
