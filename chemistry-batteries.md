1. SuperVOOC charges at [10V * 5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODeImrQs3ME), with the trick being *two* batteries inside the device at 5V each, so when you charge the two at the same time, each battery charges at 5V * 5A without having to down-convert from 10V to 5V, which normally results in heat. The two batteries still provides 5V to the device though.
1. [Main counterpoints about not charging your battery overnight](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/925633-stop-charging-your-phone-overnight/) include: misunderstanding the difference between not charging and holding a constant state of charge, claiming everyone buys another device in two years, claiming they have been charging overnight for years and nothing has yet blown up, and mixing up voltage and amperage, not knowing the entire concept has a third dependent variable: temperature.
1. [3.7V and 4.2V lithium ion batteries are the same thing.](https://learn.adafruit.com/li-ion-and-lipoly-batteries/voltages) They are just labelled differently.
1. Rechargeable AAA lithium batteries do exist. However, they are all in the wrong voltage (3.7V).
1. [Deep discharges are bad too.](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/158465/iphone-6-charging-best-practices) So you are stuck between using a battery between 49% and 50%, or wherever it is when charging voltages reaches 3.92V (54%). [See also: "lithium batteries undergo unwanted chemical reactions when discharged below 3V, causing their internal resistance to be permanently and significantly raised"](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/219236)
1. At the cost of load capacity, thermal stability, and weight, lithium battery manufacturers can raise the battery voltage using additives, which increases capacity.
1. When it comes to longevity, [lithium batteries are perfectly fine with the cold](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_at_high_and_low_temperatures) (0°C) [except when charging](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/263036/why-charging-li-ion-batteries-in-cold-temperatures-would-harm-them), and [should](https://www.xda-developers.com/charging-comparison-oneplus-huawei/) charge under 45°C (ideally under 30°C, but who does that), and strictly prohibited above 50°C or below 0°C.
1. According to [your own math](http://imgur.com/xa11NdK) in wear and tear per charging cycle, you get the most bang for your buck from your personal (3.85V nominal, 4.4V charging) Li-pol battery if you charge from 20% to 50%. (You can charge from 40% to 50% and get like 100x the cell life, but if you charge just 10% every time, you need to charge 10x as often.) [Ideal is keeping a battery between 75% and 65%.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries) If you want to use your battery like a normal person, charging from 20% to 70% isn't that bad.
1. Fast chargers [totally](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/ultra_fast_chargers) destroy your batteries. BU-401a from 2012/2017 shows bumping charge rate to anything above [1C](batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/what_is_the_c_rate) ("one hour charge/discharge") significantly reduces total cycles, and [BU-808](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries) says anything above 4.2V harmful for cycle count as well. [The ideal charging voltage is 3.92V, and cycle count is halved for every 0.1V above that.](https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210224725-Charging-research-and-methodology)
1. "In general, a [swollen battery](https://www.tekrevue.com/swollen-battery/) occurs when the battery's cells are overcharged." Overcharging oxidises the elctrolytes in the cells, turning them into gas.
1. [NiMH batteries should be taken out of the charger shortly after charging completes](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/do_and_dont_battery_table).
1. To charge 3Ah in an hour, calling that 1C rate, obviously takes a 3A charger.
1. Making a battery pack that can both charge and discharge at the same time [apparently](https://www.anker.com/products/A1272011) has detrimental effects on the lifespan of the battery. **WAIT**: what the hell is your phone doing while charging then? **WAIT 2**: it might just be a way to prevent you from making the battery charge itself.
1. [(Not charging to the max voltage) reduces the capacity the battery stores](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries). "As a simple guideline, every 70mV reduction in charge voltage lowers the overall capacity by 10 percent", but can be fixed any time by charging to the max voltage.
