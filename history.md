When the concord (which offered what's first-class service at the time) failed, business further segmented their business class from business to first-class.

They would then undergo months of rigorous training to herd their fighting skills, and when they weren't training, they would be well fed, and be pampered by Roman baths and massages. It's quite weird to say this, but a good comparison of how a gladiator was handpicked and cared for is with the same way racehorses are treated today. A lot of money went into these games, so the Romans wanted to put on the best possible show."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVAxzf1HdH4)

As being buried in a faulty pyramid would be a huge loss of face , Sneferu commissioned a third pyramid, simultaneously as they were salvaging the Bent Pyramid and converting his first pyramid to a true one, just in case Sneferu died before his 3rd pyramid was finished. Needless to say, this triple construction project put a huge strain on Egypy's economy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/comments/a9okam/how_bout_we_build_3_pyramids_at_the_same_time/ecl1qkt/)
