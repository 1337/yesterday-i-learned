It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But _I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement_. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years." Note how he didn't say _the_ billion-dollar mistake, simply one that was his.

That, or it could have been a form of [systems collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse#Systems_science), where the society grew so large that the cost to maintain it exceeds the "GDP" the civilisation could muster. The Roman empire is said to have failed that way.

They would then undergo months of rigorous training to herd their fighting skills, and when they weren't training, they would be well fed, and be pampered by Roman baths and massages. It's quite weird to say this, but a good comparison of how a gladiator was handpicked and cared for is with the same way racehorses are treated today.
