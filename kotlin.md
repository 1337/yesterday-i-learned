- The name "Kotlin" came from [Kotlin Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_Island), not an anagram of anything, such as _Kinton_.
- Kotlin was _invented_ by JetBrains, the people who made Android Studio. It is impossible not to get first-class support for it.
- There is a repl (called `kotlinc-jvm`), but it's hella slow. [Install with instructions.](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)
- [Kotlin has longer compilation times compared to Java](https://medium.com/keepsafe-engineering/kotlin-vs-java-compilation-speed-e6c174b39b5d), with the exception of incremental builds, which may match Java's compile time. So, while developer efficiency goes up (with less boilerplate code), machine efficiency goes down. A fair tradeoff.
- [`f() ?: g()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_operator) is `f() ? f() : g()`, except `f` doesn't get called twice.
- Apparently, one of Kotlin's big selling points is [null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html), where normal variables can never point to a `null`. But [`null` is still a thing](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html) and can be explicitly checked and/or allowed (by adding `?` after the variable name declaration). [Saying "no more `NullPointerException`" is **not** true](https://clearbridgemobile.com/java-vs-kotlin-which-is-the-better-option-for-android-app-development/).
- In constrast, instead of using `?` to make something nullable, you can use [`!!`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#the--operator) to make sure something absolutely isn't null, usually when you run java code, which has no null safety. (Yes, it then crashes if something is null.)
- A [data class](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html) (the Java equivalent would be a generic class with getters, setters, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`?) is built-in, using `data class ClassName(*val fields)`. All it does is contain data.
- A nullable variable cannot have its methods called unless its null-ness is checked (literally, in your code, write `!= null`).
- **Classes can have multiple constructors**, but only one unique [primary constructor](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors). The primary one is just the stuff you put inside `class ClassName constructor(*args)`. All other constructors need to reference the primary constructor one way or the other.
- `init` blocks are pre-constructor methods. A class can have any number of these, interleved with [pretty much anything you like](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#constructors), including statements. _And then_ constructors are called.
- Kotlin does not have a `new` keyword.
- The default base class is `Any`. All classes implicitly inherit from `Any`.
- "Overridable" methods are called "open functions", and must be called that to be overridden (e.g. `open fun foo() { ... }`). Overridden methods must also call themselves overrides (e.g. `override fun foo() { ... })`. Like Java, any function that is not open can have `final` in front of it to ensure it is never overridden.
- Classes _themselves_ must also be marked as open/override and final with the [`open class`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-for-py/inheritance.html) syntax.
- Properties (i.e. attributes) must also be marked as open/override and final.
- [A file can contain multiple classes.](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) See also: coding conventions.
- So Kotlin classes ("KClass") are [not](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/reflection.html) Java classes. To get the reference to a class, use `ClassName::class` (a KClass) instead of just `ClassName`. To get the Java class equivalent, use `SomeJavaClass::class.java` instead.
- Method calls can seemingly contain bodies for no reason. See this example: `assert(widget is GoodWidget) { "Bad widget: ${widget::class.qualifiedName}" }`
- A lambda's parameters are declared [**inside** its braces](https://medium.com/@dbottillo/kotlin-by-examples-methods-and-lambdas-25aef7544365), so `onClick({ view -> doSomething() })` is a lambda. If you hate that, you're in luck, because if you don't need any arguments, you can skip `view ->` and make it look like something sane, i.e. `onClick({ doSomething() })`.
- For some reason, instead of stopping there, kotlin enjoys having function arguments outside the parents _iff it is the last argument of the function call_, so you get `onClick() { doSomething() }` instead. But wait, there's fucking more. If the function call takes just one thing, and that one thing is a function, then you have to skip the parentheses anyway, resulting in the final form: `onClick { doSomething() }`.
- But if you want to pass in a named function? Fuck you, use parens: `onClick(doSomething)`.
- The `with(obj, func)` built-in (bearing in mind the last argument is a function, so the lambda stuff above syntactically applies) is the same as [what you used to use in VB6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement): unresolved names are to be found in the object's attributes.
- Comment styles are the same as the majority of others (`//`, `/* */`).
- Built-in keywords can be [hard or soft](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/keyword-reference.html). You cannot change hard ones, like `if`/`else`, `class`, and `fun`. You _can_ change soft keywords like `file`, `get`, and `set`.
- ALL functions with blocks, i.e. not a one-liner, need an explicit `return` statement.
- Because you need to declare parameter types now, the type of a lambda is usually `() -> Unit`, unless they take arguments.
- The function that accepts a lambda specifies what types the lambda needs to take. The lambdas themselves do not need to (but can) do that.
- ["In most cases, Kotlin follows the Java coding conventions"](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html#formatting), where the [official Oracle Java convention](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) says "Avoid lines longer than 80 characters ... Examples for use in documentation should have a shorter line lengthâ€”generally nomore than 70 characters."
- A one-liner lambda that takes a single argument can be written as something like `it % 2` instead of `num -> num % 2`.
- Java's "anything of some type" syntax, `<?>`, might have been replaced by `<*>`.
- An array of strings is [`Array<String>`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44239940/1558430). An array of ints is either [`IntArray`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int-array/index.html), because it's a modern language and is very consistent, or `Array<Int>`, which is not proven to work.
- A google map won't load until [you add the key](https://www.raywenderlich.com/230-introduction-to-google-maps-api-for-android-with-kotlin).
- unlike Java, functions can be top-level. It has however no static methods. The "static method" equivalent would be setting up a [`companion object`](https://android.jlelse.eu/daily-kotlin-static-methods-9330552cde8a). Any method you put in that object (similar syntax to how to put methods in ES6 classes) will be effectively static.
- [Coroutines are not strictly-speaking threads](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines), but in some cases they are implemented as such.
- The built-in [`arrayOf(...args)`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44239869/whats-the-kotlin-equivalent-of-javas-string) gives you an array of those args. You don't need to specify the types. If you want to have an empty array, guess what? `emptyArray()`
- `getApplicationContext()` becomes `applicationContext` in Kotlin, even though it is a "global".
- Double quotes are still strings. Single quotes are still chars.
- Then `when` built-in, actually just `switch-case`, requires you to specify `->` in front of each case's code block, i.e. `1 -> { ... }`.
- `/* Block comments /* can */ be nested. */`
- Strings can have `"substitutions like $this"` (where `val this = "this"`).
- It is possible to suffix something to a class, including seemingly built-in ones like `Number`, and instantly create a new attribute. [klock](https://korlibs.soywiz.com/klock/#unix-timestamp) does it like so: `DateTime.now() + 10.seconds` (where `seconds` is an attribute on `Number` now.)
- [Nested `this`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/this-expressions.html) can be a problem sometimes. JS tackles this by allowing you to assign `this` to some variable. Kotlin allows you to refer to `this` with `this@OuterClassName`. This works at any level.
