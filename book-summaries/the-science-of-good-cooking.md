1. professionals measure things by mass. Volume can be off for things like flour.
1. can't trust time either. It takes different times to cook fish in different shapes. Just cook until a desired texture is achieved.
1. use a real thermometer. The oven ones are shit. Then measure twice.
1. cooking makes proteins easier to digest. This has been linked to the increase in brain size.
1. previously frozen meats dry quicker when cooking because the cells have been ruptured. So, don't freeze meats.
1. salt masks bitter flavours, including coffee, eggplant, and Tylenol.
1. sugar masks spicy flavours. Apparently the brain debating whether the taste is more pleasure or pain.
1. acids like lemon juice can compete with bitter flavours and brighten the dish.
1. add rosemary and thyme before cooking so they can release the flavour. Add parsley and basil after cooking because they are more delicate.
1. onions cut from pole to pole are sweeter than ones cut along the equator. It doesn't matter if you dice.
1. non stick pans don't brown as well as conventional pans.
1. for cooking meat, you almost always want to use the lowest temperature allowed to retain moisture. If the meat comes out pale because it was never browned, then sear it a bit (before or after) to compensate.
1. use high heat briefly to develop flavour not originally found in meat (like melaloidin pigments from? the Maillard reaction)
1. when buying shrimp, go for frozen, unpeeled, untreated.
1. the Maillard reaction starts at 300 degrees F.
1. you have to marinate the meat you stir fry. Marinating has a brining effect.
1. When stir frying, add the ginger and garlic last so they don't burn. Add a teaspoon of corn starch so the sauce doesn't run.
1. the grey stuff right underneath salmon skin is high in omega 3 fatty acids.
1. wild salmon is definitely better than farmed salmon if cooked.
1. coating fish with sugar helps brown it.
1. ‎buy fish anywhere, as long as you know they sell lots of fish.
1. ‎tuck your fish when you cook so the whole piece has even thickness.
1. ‎rest the meat for 10 minutes to get more moisture.
1. "natural pork" doesn't have sodium phosphate injected into it. It tastes better.
1. ‎Carryover cooking goes for 20 minutes after the food leaves the pan, so you have to stop cooking before the internal temperature is met.
1. ‎elevate a roast to ensure even cooking. Then, when it's done, let it rest for a few minutes to let the muscle fibres relax.
1. ‎large bird roasts like turkey can be crispened by taking it out of the even, resting for to minutes, and then putting it back into the oven at 500F for 15 minutes.
1. ‎soak a cooked ham in warm water before cooking to elevate its internal temperature. This cuts cooking time.
1. to hard boil eggs, start cold, and stop when the water boils. Let sit for 10 minutes.
1. stir fry is appealing because it quickly develops flavour for both the meat and the vegetables.
1. to make meat easier to slice, freeze for 15 minutes.
1. ‎For stir fries, add garlic and ginger last, which burn easily.
1. fish collagen is converted to gelatin at 130f. So, never cook fish above 140f. For salmon, cook to 125f.
1. cook scallop with lemon brine to mask the off taste.
1. ‎freezer burn happens only between the meat and the wrap used to contain the moisture.
1. ‎to make perfect medium rare steak, stop when the internal temperature is 120f. It will keep cooking itself and turn into medium rare. If you plan to roast it first, start pan frying when internal temperature is 90 degrees.
1. ‎there is no carryover cooking for whole fish and chicken since the body is hollow.
1. roasting a steak before searing it reduces moisture loss (while bringing the internal temperature to the required number).
1. searing does not lock in moisture.
1. ‎freezing chicken for more than 2 months makes it tougher.
1. ‎do cook steak with oil in the pan.
1. ‎patting meat dry allows Browning to occur. So don't skip this step.
1. you can dry age beef at home yourself if you can keep a chunk of beef wrapped in plenty of cheesecloth for a few days at the back of the fridge.
1. tough cuts of meat are meant to be cooked above 140f, so the collagen breaks down. You'll lose a lot of moisture in the process though, so wrap the whole thing in foil.
1. store bayleaves in the freezer.
1. braising does not retain moisture.the perceived feeling of moist is from the broken down collagen.
1. ‎Braise in the oven. It has more even heating.
1. Browning eventually also happens if you leave the meat cooking for a really long time.
1. chicken breasts have white meat because they don't fly. If they were to fly like ducks then they would have dark meat there, too.
1. ‎en cocotte ("in a prostitute") are cooking things in (tiny) Dutch ovens.
1. ‎bones are 40 percent collagen and narrow and lined with fat so naturally they can deliver flavour if cooked with a cut of meat.
1. potatoes cooked in just bones can suddenly taste meaty.
1. ‎cool soup (maybe you like cold soup) for an hour at room temperature before putting it in the fridge.
1. ‎brine lean meat to make it taste juicier. This works using osmosis. This means the concentration of the brine is critical in order for water to go in, not out. Use a cup of salt for every 4 "quarts" of water. Brine for four hours.
1. you can brine and thaw frozen meat at the same time.
