# Writing Clear, Effective Policies and Procedures

Summarising [a slideshow](https://oldwww.ws.afnog.org/afnog2013/cte/thursday/afnog-policy-procedure.pdf) summarising [the book](https://www.amazon.ca/Writing-Effective-Policies-Procedures-Step/dp/081447960X)... *imagine that*!

# Policies vs Procedures

Policies tell you what to do. Procedures tell you how to do them (steps). Both use active voice (i.e. subject-verb-object, "you do this, others do that").

# How to write clearly, in general

* Eliminate ambiguity. Be aware of all possible interpretations.
* Use simple words and short sentences (15 words or less).
* Avoid weasel words like "may" and "ought to". You can still use them though, when appropriate.
* Assume the reader knows nothing.

# Steps for writing policies and procedures

1. Assess the Need
2. Research Best Practice
3. Develop a Writing Plan
4. Draft and Edit the Policy and/or Procedure
5. Obtain Approval
6. Engage in Communication and Education
7. Practice Review and Revision
