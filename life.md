"Yesterday I learned how to live."

1. Happiness is what happens when what you think, what you say, and what you do are the same thing.
1. /u/Festivearea2's psychiatrist, Dr Murphy: "No one gives a shit about you." He meant and explained it as, in life there are very very very few people who will be there for you all the time, and drop everything. No one cares about what you're doing because everyone is selfish. That's just how life is. Do what YOU want to do, because it's YOUR life.
1. Blogs ideally teach others what you learned, not just rambling. (But you can... it's your own blog, I'm not the police)
1. "Never grow up, just learn to be an adult." - [Frazer271009's Dad](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bq7pbb/what_is_something_someone_said_to_you_that_hit/eo1v1m6/)

1. When someone asks "Where are you from" or "What do you do", try to respond the question with something that relates to the asker. For "What do you do", _you_ should not be asking it because not everyone is proud of what they do. If you are the one answering "What do you do", then attempt to add the word "help" into the response, i.e. ["I help people get the best Japanese candies the country has to offer,"](https://www.candyjapan.com/) rather than "I run a website that sells Japanese candies". A valid alternative to "What do you do" is "How do you spend most of your time".

1. "Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." - not necessarily Marcus Aurelius, but attributed to him anyway
1. ["I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to "not matter". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/-/c1u0rx2) - /u/GSnow

1. [Welcome criticism.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3ocfXMjBajIvUKiSQDMbog) If you don't take criticism well, you can't improve at a rate above average. If a Chinese website laughs at Hong Kong people for speaking broken Mandarin, you welcome the criticism. You practice the **fuck** out of your Mandarin. 香港人，記住唔好衰俾人睇。You improve beyond their imagination, exceeding their proficiency in their own native (and sometimes, only) tongue. And then you _don't_ laugh at their broken English, because doing so will give them the idea to improve it.
1. [Let people play their music in your car](https://www.reddit.com/r/InfluenceAdvice/comments/adtfr4/why_you_should_let_others_play_music_in_the_car/): not only does it improve the probability that at least one person (the one who's playing the music) likes the music currently playing; "Similar to the Ben Franklin effect, the acceptance of their gesture to play the songs they like will make these people like you.

1. You can calculate how much you need to invest into your retirement by reverse calculating from how much you want every month (no taxes for simplicity). Say you want $10k in passive income every month in whichever currency. A year of that is $120k, and if you say you get that much from a 5% capital growth per year, then your actual investment is 120k / 5% = 2.4M. So you will have to figure out how to get this 2.4M in 20 years. 2.4M in 20 years is (interestingly enough) back to 120k per year. So unless you save 10k every month now, you aren't retiring.

1. [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) is Minimizing Maximum Loss. Maximin is Maximizing Minimum Gain.
