If you are the one answering "What do you do", then attempt to add the word "help" into the response, i.e. ["I help people get the best Japanese candies the country has to offer,"](https://www.candyjapan.com/) rather than "I run a website that sells Japanese candies". A valid alternative to "What do you do" is "How do you spend most of your time".
