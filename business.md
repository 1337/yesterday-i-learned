* [Responsibilities of a CEO (among other things)](http://blog.staply.co/startup-legal-do-it-by-yourself)
* Acquisition is one of the things most CEOs delay until it is too late.
* Your options (if any) is worth nothing until exercised, making them tax-free.
* Your options cannot be sold back to the company. That is, unless someone else wants to buy your options, they are also worth nothing.
* Your options are immediately vested ('yours', or eqv.) at no cost if the company gets acquired.
* Your options is exerciseable up to 90 days after you leaving the company.
* Avoid stocks you find on the news (for they become unstable), "the next big thing" companies, and companies that diversify through acquisition instead of innovation.
* [The four stages of company development](http://takeaswig.com/the-end-of-the-facebook-era): Emergence (when it started), Coalescence (when it becomes large enough that people can't ignore it), Bureaucratization (when it becomes a formal giant), and Decline (when it stops being useful)
* **Speculating**: buying a company's stocks when the company isn't making a profit.

## Bonds

Issued by the government, bonds have low volatility, low risk, and low return (but beats inflation).
Bonds values do not correlate to stock market performance, so when the stock market is doing poorly, pick bonds.

However, property are vulnerable to pricing bubbles.
Property value is linked to to bonds value.

* Sell if stocks aren't appreciating (rising in value). They do nothing even if you hold on to them for a long time.
* Never spend all your money on stocks.
* Invest in a stock only if you have a good answer for "why are you investing in this particular stock?"

### Looking for a suitable company

* Read the company's *annual report*, *Standard & Poor's Stock Report* (See S&P500), and WSJ.
* *Earnings*, *earnings growth*, and *return on equity (ROE)* should be 10% higher than the year before.
* *Sales* and *Equity* (if present) should be higher than the year before.
* *Debt* should be less than half of the company's *assets*.
* The stock's *price-to-earnings ratio* should be between 20 and 40. [Generally speaking, having a high P/E ratio means that investors like you and believe that you have a bright future.](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/05/the-new-fast-food/)
* The stock's *price-to-sales ratio* should be close to 1.
