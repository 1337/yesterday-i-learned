* [Responsibilities of a CEO (among other things)](http://blog.staply.co/startup-legal-do-it-by-yourself)
* Acquisition is one of the things most CEOs delay until it is too late.
* Your options (if any) is worth nothing until exercised, making them tax-free.
* Your options cannot be sold back to the company. That is, unless someone else wants to buy your options, they are also worth nothing.
* Your options are immediately vested ('yours', or eqv.) at no cost if the company gets acquired.
* Your options is exerciseable up to 90 days after you leaving the company.
* Avoid stocks you find on the news (for they become unstable), "the next big thing" companies, and companies that diversify through acquisition instead of innovation.
* [The four stages of company development](http://takeaswig.com/the-end-of-the-facebook-era): Emergence (when it started), Coalescence (when it becomes large enough that people can't ignore it), Bureaucratization (when it becomes a formal giant), and Decline (when it stops being useful)
* **Speculating**: buying a company's stocks when the company isn't making a profit.
* Look at a company's political climate in addition to what the company's competition is doing.

# [Looking for a suitable investment class](http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/financial-planning/investments/investing-101-how-to-beat-inflation-1.1674984)

## Cash

Low volatility, no [risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/32kd0x/whether_youre_new_to_trading_or_notlean_on_these/.compact). Never beats inflation.

## Bonds

Issued by the government, bonds have low volatility, low risk, and low return (but beats inflation).
Bonds values do not correlate to stock market performance, so when the stock market is doing poorly, pick bonds.

## Property

Properties (e.g. houses that you don't live in) always beats inflation in the long term.
However, property are vulnerable to pricing bubbles.
Property value is linked to to bonds value.

## Equity ("stocks")

At the cost of high volatility, equity provides the highest return, provided that you pick the right stocks and get the timing right.

* Sell if stocks aren't appreciating (rising in value). They do nothing even if you hold on to them for a long time.
* Never spend all your money on stocks.
* Invest in a stock only if you have a good answer for "why are you investing in this particular stock?"

### Shorting

["Shorting" stocks](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/shorting-stocks.html) involves you borrowing your broker's stocks, buying your copy of these stocks at a lower price, and giving back these stocks to your broker. You end up with these stocks, and the price difference.

Similarly, [Margins](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/dangerous-moves-first-time-investors.asp?no_header_alt=true) involve borrowing money to buy stocks that (you hope it will) go up.

> Take this example – you have $100 and borrow $50 to buy $150 of a stock. If the stock rises 10% ($165), you make $15, or a 15% return on your capital. But, if the stock declines 10% ($135), you lose $15, or a 15% loss. More importantly, if the stock goes up by 50% ($225), you make 75% return. But, if the stock declines 50% ($75), you lose all your money!

### Looking for a suitable company

* Read the company's *annual report*, *Standard & Poor's Stock Report* (See S&P500), and WSJ.
* *Earnings*, *earnings growth*, and *return on equity (ROE)* should be 10% higher than the year before.
* *Sales* and *Equity* (if present) should be higher than the year before.
* *Debt* should be less than half of the company's *assets*.
* The stock's *price-to-earnings ratio* should be between 20 and 40. [Generally speaking, having a high P/E ratio means that investors like you and believe that you have a bright future.](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/05/the-new-fast-food/)
* The stock's *price-to-sales ratio* should be close to 1.

### Looking for a generic trade

* "Don't pick stocks" - [wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/5rules) (low MER index funds are good enough for most people)
* Buy gold when the market is stable. Since gold has inherent value, gold is often bought by others when the market is unstable, which is the time you should sell.
* Buy bonds when stocks are falling. (More research required)

### Looking for a suitable time

* [Buy the rumour sell the news](http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/buy-on-the-rumor-sell-on-the-news-vod-vz-t-aapl-goog0706.aspx): traders typically dump shares immediately after a new product is introduced. You should therefore buy the shares somewhere around two weeks after the release, and sell a week before the hype cycle comes to a close.

#### To buy

* Consider buying stocks in a *bull market*: a market where people are starting to gain confidence in investing.
* Never buy stocks in a *bear market*: a market whose general prices are falling, and people are being pessimistic.

#### [To sell](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/5-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stock.aspx)

* When the price is right (hits your target)
* When the company is no longer doing its business the right way or making enough sales
* When a better stock exists
* When the company is acquired
* When the company goes bankrupt (selling it doesn't give you money, but you can claim it as capital loss)

## [Management](https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/21-management-things-i-learned-at-imgur-7abb72bdf8bf)
