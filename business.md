* Your options are immediately vested ('yours', or eqv.) at no cost if the company gets acquired.
* Your options is exerciseable up to 90 days after you leaving the company.

Properties (e.g. houses that you don't live in) always beats inflation in the long term.
However, property are vulnerable to pricing bubbles.
Property value is linked to to bonds value.
