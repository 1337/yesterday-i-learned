* In HTML5, `<style>` tags must have the `scoped` attribute if they are in the `<body>` tag. Styles will be applied to its parent and siblings.

* `<meta property="og:image" content="(the facebook share thumbnail)">`
* There is a [`time`](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_time.asp) tag in HTML5, and [it does something](http://jsfiddle.net/trevoro/T4wRq/) if you [tell it to](http://trevoro.net/2013/whats-your-timezone/).

The only two browsers I suspect trouble are firefox and opera.
