# Engine
* Vehicle break-in mileage was 1600km.
* There seems to be no min crank time, but the maximum recommended crank time is still 30 seconds.
* 140 km/h is your particular vechicle's maximum rating. There are [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLXmNvEtEK0) showing 170km/h, but you know what will happen.
* Your vehicle, even with 128 lbÂ·ft of torque, cannot officially tow. Toyota "does not recommend" it. (02-05) Interestingly, they don't recommend towing for the 2.4L either.
* Your engine is fitted with iridium-tipped spark plugs. Use only "DENSO SC20HR11" spark plugs.
* Cold engines consume more fuel than warmed engines.
* You are supposed to warm this engine. Not warming your engine allows moisture to accumulate in the engine, costing more than just an oil change.
* There is no clutch. There is only a torque converter.
* Engine braking will never operate while cruise control is active. (02-01)

# Transmission
* Gear ratios are 2.34 (reverse), 2.85, 1.55, 1.00, and 0.70 (overdrive).
* Toyota's automatic transmission fluid is claimed to be lifetime, but at 150k it should be changed. Brown or black fluids should also be changed. Pink or tan are both fine.

# Fuel
* Use unleaded gasoline, with an octane rating of 87+.
* Gasoline cannot contain more than 10% ethanol. It cannot contain methanol.
* Your tank is 50L.

# Tires
* Your tire size is P205/55R16 89H. Donut spares are T135/80R16 101M, *or* T135/70R17 102M.
* Your tires are supposed to be at 32 PSI (06-01). The spare, however, should go up to 60 PSI.
* Do not mix tire types (winter/all-season)
* Do not mix tire sizes
* Tires over 6 years old must be checked. Damage may not be obvious.
* Rotate your tires in a way described in `13.pdf`. It improves tire life.

# Power Steering
* The vehicle comes with electric power steering.
* Do not hold the steering wheel on either side for a long time. It will damage the motor.

# Brakes
* You might (02-01) have a "drum-in-disc" parking brake. It uses the inside of rear discs as a drum.
* Parking brakes can freeze. Do not use the handbrake in the winter. Use only "P" (the parking pawl).
* Pumping the ABS brake pedal makes the stopping distance longer.
* Your car hardly ever engages ABS, even when you try to brake-test.
* You *should* use engine braking instead of brakes while travelling downhill. (02-01)
* There are two hydraulic braking systems, both of which would keep working if either fails.
* Squealing means "there is no brake pad left". Incidentally, the same sound is also what cheap ceramic brakes make during operation.
* The vehicle might have sliding brake calipers, which only has pistons on one side. This contributes to uneven brake wear, particularly in bad weather conditions.
* Raybestos is a good (brake) brand, depending on what variety your get from them. The "Enhanced Hybrid Technology" series is supposedly as good as OE.
* Old brake fluid is murky and black. New fluid (your vehicle: FMVSS 116 / DOT 3) is clear straw yellow. (04-03)
* If you want to change your brake fluid, [remove whatever you can get out of the reseroir, and put in new brake fluid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5O_pbC8R2E) It is unlikely for you to be able to *bleed* your own brake fluid [on your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1NvtUwfRJc), however.
* Items you may require/receive along with your brake pad package includes:
    * Abutment Clips
    * Piston Clips
    * Spreader Springs
    * Anti-Rattle Clips
    * Mechanical Wear Sensors
* Brake rotors are surprisingly fragile, and need to be replaced if warped or worn thin by the brakes. Calipers might also require replacement.
* Brake fluid and brake lube are not fictitious liquids like the blinker fluid.

# Dashboard / Odometer
* To change the meter display, quickly push and release the knob. 
* To reset the trip meter A to zero, display the meter A reading, then push and hold the knob until the meter is set to zero. The same process can be applied for resetting the trip meter B.
* An "E" next to your thermometer means "Error".
* Every marker on the fuel gauge is around 100km worth of fuel (80, 100, 120, 300, 380).

# AC
* The AC takes air in from below the windshield. Make sure it is not blocked by snow.
* Fresh air intake defrosts faster than inside air.
* Recirculated air cools faster than outside air.
* AC doesn't work below 0 degrees.

# Maintenance
* Your car is equipped with *On-board Diagnostics* (OBD II) to make the flashing lights happen.

Every 8000km:
* Rotate tires
* Set tire pressures to correct psi
* Check that all exterior light bulbs are functioning
* Inspect front and rear brake components
* Inspect and top off fluid levels
* Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body

Every 16000km or one year:
* Change engine oil and filter

Every 24000km:
* Inspect condition of drive axle boots
* Check condition of brake fluid (this should be replaced every 2, 3 years)
* Check transfer case and differential fluids
* Check operation of cooling system and/or indication of coolant leak
* Complete inspection of steering and suspension components
* Complete inspection of exhaust system
* Inspect air filter
* Inspect cabin air filter
* Lubricate drive shaft (where applicable)
* Inspect fuel lines and charcoal canister
* Reset maintenance/tire pressure warning lights

Every 48000km:
* Inspect ignition wires

# Repair
* `04-02` is a daily maintenance checklist. `04-03` is a DIY checklist.
* `04-01`: waxing.
* `19.pdf` (oil level) is the most important document. 
* `18.pdf` (engine) has a diagram of the front of the car.
* `20.pdf` describes fuse/headlight/lightbulb replacement procedures.
* `05-02` is the emergency repair document, e.g. flooded engines, jump-starting, flat tires.
* Tow your car out of a ditch with a hook near the center back of the vehicle.
* Toyota can make you a new key if you tell them your key number (?).
* If the turn signal indicator lights (green lights) on the instrument panel flash faster than normal, a front or rear turn signal bulb is burned out.

# Safety
* Your front airbags open only if you are hit from the front. They will not open to side impacts or rollovers.
* Your airbags can kill you. Don't do stupid things.
* Nothing, including stickers, should be attached to the steering wheel.
* Do not attach windscreen accessories. (01-07)
* The lever on your rear view mirror is actually an anti-glare feature. It reduces clarity, however.
* Coasting in neutral in this particular vehicle conserves fuel only when travelling downhill.
* Press the panic button for 1 second to activate panic mode. Press any button again to cancel.
* If doors are unlocked but not opened, they will be re-locked in a minute.
* Cruise control will deactivate itself if VSC kicks in. It is not a replacement for missing right legs.

## Winter driving
* The gauge beside the fuel level gauge is the coolant temperature gauge. It tells you if your engine is overheating.
* Ethyl-1,2-diol is your only choice of coolant *and* antifreeze.
* New coolant makes your heat hotter.
* Water can be an emergency coolant (05-02).
* Engine antifreeze can damage the car's paint.
* Long-life coolants can last 100Mm (or 5 years). If you don't like seeing dirt, or like seeing something completely clean, [ignorance is bliss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s--5ft5YiHg). One flush doesn't do anything.
* The required oil type is 0W-20. 5W-20 may be used temporarily until the next oil change.
* 0W-20 lasts one year. 5W-20 lasts half a year. You will need 4.2L of it. (06-01)
* Bring along tire chains, window scraper, bag of sand or salt, flares, small shovel, jumper cables, etc.
* Locating the weight as far forward as possible helps maintain stability.
* `3`, `2` (92km/h max) and `L` (44km/h max) are engine braking positions. In these low gears, the engine can easily overheat. Drive with caution.
* The shifter appears to be gated, but never operates like one. While it is possible to shift without the brake pedal while driving, it is not at all recommended.
* Rocking the signal stick up and down is for left/right signals. Forward and backward are for two-stage hi-beams.
* Pulling the washer thingy toward you will squirt washer fluid.
* That "defrost" button next to the emergency stop button heats the rear mirror, as well as the side mirrors.
* Defrosting does not make snow go away.
* Turning off the engine while driving, in attempt to stop quicker before an accident, paradoxically makes power braking stop working, which makes braking take longer. (02-01)

# Misc
* This vehicle is not waterproof. Water will enter the cabin in heavy rain.
* Shifter lock activation can be *DE*activated via instructions in section 01-02. Basically, close all the doors, turn on the engine, and hold (lock/unlock) for 5 seconds while the shifter is in P or N.
* Wiper blade sizes are 26", 17", and 12". When replacing the rear wiper, remember to keep the OEM covers.
* Using the rear wiper when the window is dry will damage both parts. There is no good reason to do so. (02-03)
* The vehicle can only be towed with the two **front** wheels lifted up.
* Your "maintenance required" does not turn on because only USA versions have it. (05-02)
* Wheel covers are not locked by the wheel nuts.
