1. [Service roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontage_road) are roads running parallel to highways. Living on a service road is often a poor idea, because service roads can only go one way.
1. Before the second world war, [Europe had 50:50 mixed opinions about which side of the road to drive on](https://i.redd.it/zhaj9kiw5ha11.png), including driving on either side being an option in Italy.
1. [You can't do a U-turn at an intersection in Alberta](https://globalnews.ca/news/974813/road-rules-are-u-turns-allowed/) (unless it says you can).
1. [Automated parking tickets might not need to be paid. Check your local laws before paying up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6ispco/a_controversial_bill_passed_by_a_house_committee/)
1. Cars in the left lane turning left during the brief period when both traffic lights are red, known as the [Pittsburgh left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_left), is a terrible idea, even in Pittsburgh.
1. To kill yourself by car these days (haha yes), the best chance you have is [drive into the right end of a truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3G-kcKN70), where even Canadian standards will fail you.
1. Cars turning left at an intersection have no right of way, even [compared to cars trying to turn right into a different lane.](https://www.insurancehotline.com/understanding-right-of-way-common-scenarios/)
1. In the event of a blowout, you aren't supposed to brake, as it forces you to fishtail.
1. Hold your steering wheel at 10 and 2 [only if you don't have power steering.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9fu3SBm-PU)
1. It is not legal (in many jurisdictions) to turn left into a left turn lane. The lane is only for turning left from it.
1. The [optimal driving speeds](http://eartheasy.com/move_fuel_efficient_driving.html) are 50km/h and 90km/h.
1. Understeer: the front wheels are fully turned, but the car is still going forward.
1. Oversteer: the front wheels are turning fine, but the back is steering too much.
1. The body should not swivel when performing the shoulder check. This puts the car at risk of drifting.
1. [People who live in trucks and vans](https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/5mk4vb/consuming_alcohol/) and drink may be charged with DUI, even if they have no intention of going anywhere.

1. Flashing yellow at a two-or-four-way-stop means ["disregard me, I mean nothing"](http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section3.2.12.shtml). On the other hand, flashing red means a mandatory stop.
1. [It is not illegal to drive barefoot](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/strange-canadian-driving-laws-that-surprised-us-the-most-in-2015/article27951066/), but since it has less grip than shoes, you probably shouldn't.
1. "We have an anti-evasion law around here which makes it illegal for you to knowingly and intentionally go below the speed limit in order to avoid the possibility of going over and getting a ticket. The penalty is 30 days in jail vs the $100 speeding ticket. Since you admitted to intentionally going under the speed limit, I'm placing you under arrest."
1. The reasoning behind [colors for traffic lights] is because Green represents life flourishing and going. Red was a sign of life stopped and yellow was a caution that would mean red is coming.
