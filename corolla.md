Gasoline, Tank, and Exhaust
======================
* Use unleaded gasoline, with an octane rating of 87+.
* Toyota recommends use of gasolines that contain detergent additives to avoid build- up of engine deposits.
* Gasoline cannot contain more than 10% ethanol, or 5% methanol.
* Your tank is 50L.
* The three- way catalytic converter is an emission control device installed in the exhaust system. It is at the bottom middle of the car.
* The catalytic converter converts CO into CO2 (or something). 
* The catalytic converter can overheat if you drive with low fuel levels, or leave idle for 20+ minutes.

Tires
======================
* Your tire size is P185/65R14. 175 is not okay. 60R is not okay.
* Summer tires: high speed, low traction, good for highway driving
* All-season tires: better traction, doesn't work with heavy or loose snow
* Do not mix tire types
* Do not mix tire sizes

Engine
======================
* A new engine consumes more oil, since its pistons, piston rings and cylinder walls have not become conditioned.
* Max crank (start car) time is 30 seconds.
* There is also a min crank time.
* 140 km/h is your particular vechicle's maximum rating.
* Your vehicle can tow a maximum of 680 kg (1500 lb), where the max tongue load (mass actually exerted on the car instead of the trailer's tires) is 68 kg).
* Your engine is fitted with twin ground electrode spark plugs. Use only twin ground electrode spark plugs.
* "Always turn the overdrive switch on for better fuel economy and quieter driving." (that is, pressed in)

Winter driving
======================
* The gauge beside the fuel level gauge is the coolant temperature gauge. It tells you if your engine is overheating.
* Your coolant must contain ethylene- glycol type coolant for a proper corrosion protection of aluminum components.
* Do not use alcohol antifreeze. Use 50%-60% antifreeze.
* Engine antifreeze can damage the car's paint.
* Make sure the engine oil viscosity is suitable for the cold weather. Leaving a heavy summer oil in your vehicle during winter months may cause harder starting.
* Squirt lock de- icer or glycerine into the locks to keep them from freezing. 
* To open a frozen lock, try heating the key before inserting it.
* Parking brakes can freeze. Do not use the handbrake in the winter. Use only "P".
* Bring along tire chains, window scraper, bag of sand or salt, flares, small shovel, jumper cables, etc.
* Pumping the ABS brake pedal makes the stopping distance longer.
* Locating the weight as far forward as possible helps maintain balance.
* `2` and `L` are engine braking positions. In these low gears, the engine can easily overheat. Drive with caution.
* `2` and `L` are not available when overdrive is on.
* Never shift while pedalling.
* Rocking the signal stick up and down is for left/right signals. Forward and backward are for hi-beams.
* Pulling the washer thingy toward you will squirt washer fluid.
* That "defrost" button next to the emergency stop button only heats the rear mirror.

AC
======================
* If the AC is broken, its light will flash.
* The AC takes air in from below the windshield. Make sure it is not blocked by snow.
* Fresh air intake defrosts faster than inside air.

Repair
======================
* `5.pdf` is a daily maintenance checklist.
* `4.pdf`: waxing.
* `19.pdf` (oil level) is the most import document. 
* `18.pdf` (engine) has a diagram of the front of the car.
* `20.pdf` describes fuse/headlight/lightbulb replacement procedures.
* `3.pdf` is the emergency repair document, e.g. flooded engines, jump-starting, flat tires.
* Do not tow with sling-type trucks. It does not work for your car.
* Toyota can make you a new key if you tell them your key number (?).
* If the turn signal indicator lights (green lights) on the instrument panel flash faster than normal, a front or rear turn signal bulb is burned out.


Dashboard / Odometer
======================
* To change the meter display, quickly push and release the knob. 
* To reset the trip meter A to zero, display the meter A reading, then push and hold the knob until the meter is set to zero. The same process can be applied for resetting the trip meter B.
* An "E" next to your thermometer means "Error".

Safety
======================
* Your airbags open only if you are hit from the front. They will not open to side impacts or rollovers.
* Your airbags can kill you. Don't do stupid things.
* The lever on your rearview mirror is actually an anti-glare feature. It reduces clarity, however.
* Tires over 6 years old must be checked. Damage may not be obvious.
* Rotate your tires in a way described in `13.pdf`. It improves tire life.

Misc
======================
* That thing below the cup holder is apparently an ashtray.
* `7.pdf` describes trailer and towing instructions. It recommends against axle-mounted hitches.
