* CoffeeScript should not exist.
* Wrapping JS code in backticks makes it legal CoffeeScript.
* I take that back. It doesn't work everywhere.
* Only in CoffeeScript: [classical classes](http://coffeescript.org/#classes), optional arguments (`foo = (bar = {}) ->`), argument unpacking (`foo.bar(args...)`)
* In multi-line arrays, commas are optional. Trailing commas are also removed.
