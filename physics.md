- Jupiter's red spot is about the size of the Earth. It has 79 moons, more than the sun has planets. Inside Jupiter you can find [gaseous hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, and metallic hydrogen layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#/media/File:Jupiter_diagram.svg).
- [Quantum supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy) is a specific term describing quantum computers being able to do work better than normal ones.
- In free space, teleportation _appears_ the same as travelling at the speed of light. In real life, teleportation has the advantage of being able to enter closed spaces.
- Portable air conditioners with two hoses (instead of one or zero) are more efficient. Those with zero hoses are just useless, one pipe takes cool air from the inside, which requires it to work harder.
- Apart from personal preference, there is [no](https://www.anandtech.com/show/9394/analysing-amoled-power-efficiency) [point](https://www.xda-developers.com/amoled-black-vs-gray-dark-mode/) setting your phone UI to pure black instead of dark grey, in the name of saving energy on an AMOLED screen.
- Circular floaters (in the eye) are brighter in the middle because of [Poisson's bright spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arago_spot), something [Poisson didn't even believe in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9c8oZ49pFc), says that light (as a wave) constructively interferes with light diffracting around each side of a circular object.
- Glass is an amorphous solid. So no, it is not a liquid. You can tell glass doesn't "flow" or eventually distort by looking at hundred-year-old optical instruments, which still work.
- [Microwave grape plasma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCrtk-pyP0I) is due to, in short, microwave, which has a wavelength of 1.2cm in water, getting trapped inside the grape. When two grapes touch, the energy is trapped right in between instead.
- The [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit) is (after 2019) defined using the planck constant. This means the kilogram requires the Metre and the Second to be defined. With the second being defined by the caesium-133 frequency, and the metre being defined as the distance light travels after a second... the caesium-133 atom (the stuff we use in atomic clocks) is actually the element with the most impact on the stability of the SI units.
- [An incandescent lamp's lifetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Light_output_and_lifetime) is roughly proportional to its operating voltage V ^{-16}. "This means that a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%."
- No one builds [jello pools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPZzrlFCD_I) because, firstly, the temperature required (first boil a pool's worth of jello... and then cool it, but not freeze it) is hard to control; and secondly, after all that effort, jello breaks.
- An electron and positron spin together to form a [positronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positronium), an unstable state. When they annihilate each other, they turn into two or three photons, depending on their spin states.
- [Quantum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) pull the universe apart. Assuming the theory holds true, specifically the [vacuum energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy) part of it, this explains why [galaxies are moving away from us faster and faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe).
- The Earth is actually closer to the sun during the northern hemisphere's winter. Seasons are largely affected by the tilt. Also, most of Africa is in the southern hemisphere, if you haven't noticed already.
- Only robots sink in lava. Humans don't sink into lava.
- Short gamma ray bursts are generated when (including) neutron stars merge. Long gamma ray bursts are generated when [supernovae collapse into a black hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY). Theories even suggest maybe there isn't much more life in space because GRBs are killing lifeforms on a regular basis.
- Cold water is audibly different from hot water. (That means you can hear the difference between the two being poured, and you know which is which.)
- At [194 dB](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2huwbq/why_is_the_loudest_sound_possible_194_db/) or dBA (dB adjusted for the human ear), [sound waves become shock waves](https://www.noisehelp.com/noise-level-chart.html).
- Olber's Paradox: since there are lots of stars in the sky, can nothing stops photons from coming to us, we should see a bright sky. But it's not the case because the universe is not infinitely old, and the photons from these stars don't have time to arrive to us yet.
- Time dilation can also be thought of as [length contraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVzDP8SMhPo). An object that is travelling at the speed of light towards you, also thinks you are travelling at light speed towards it. And you look just a fraction of your actual length dependent on your speed. This allows muons, which would normally only travel 500m before going away, to travel 10km worth of atmosphere. [Time dilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQC3ErD1YwE) is relatively insignificant unless you're travelling at >70% the speed of light.
- Shutter _speed_ and exposure _time_, being synonyms, are both units of time.
- Noise reduction by averaging two photos only reduces noise by [the square root of the number of measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_averaging).
- The unit Kelvin does not come with the word "degrees" because it is considered absolute. Also, Since the triple point of water is at 273.16K but 0 degrees Celsius is 273.15K, [water actually boils at 99.974 degrees Celsius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjht4oAByCI).
- For paranoid people who think [people can see them through walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBFMsY5ZP0o), [EMF shielding paints](https://lessemf.com/paint.html) is for you!
- [Cold fusion exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDfB3gnxRhc). Muons ("heavy electrons") hold nuclei 200x closer together, making them much more likely to fuse, which means it can occur at room temperature. Unfortunately the input energy to generate a muon is still higher than the energy you get back from fusion, so it's still useless right now.
- Drag has a square relationship with velocity. This makes "making a huge gun that shoots people into space" inpractical.
- Uranus (the 7th planet) is larger but lighter than Neptune (the 8th planet).
- The original frequency of a signal is the fundamental frequency. Slight distortions of the original signal may also cause harmonic signals to be present. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 2 kHz, then the second harmonic signal would be 4 kHz and the third harmonic signal would be 6 kHz. etc.
- A Decibel (dB) (`10⋅log₁₀(Power out/Power in)`) is indeed a deci of a Bel, which was named after a guy with the last name Bell.
- Home voltages are between 120V to 240V. At least these are the figures reported by ISED Canada.
- The voltage drop across a resistance can be measured with a volt meter across the terminals. If the current and resistance is known, voltage drop can be calculated using Ohms law: E = I R. (E =volts I = amps R= ohms).
- The reciprocal of resistance is conductance. A circuit with high conductance has low resistance and vice versa.
- Carbon is the most-commonly used material for building resistors.
- The ionosphere is most ionised during midday, because that's when there is the most sun.
- Taping windows during a hurricane [does little to protect people](https://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/storms/10-pieces-of-disaster-safety-advice-you-should-ignore3.htm), since glass is still glass, and taping only controls how big the shards are.
- [Liquid or liquid-like cargo can sloth inside the ship, making the ship less stable.](https://theconversation.com/mystery-of-the-cargo-ships-that-sink-when-their-cargo-suddenly-liquefies-101158)
- Capacitive touchscreens work with any conductor. They just need a big enough surface area to register as a proper finger.
- A [pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_%28signal_processing%29) that lasts literally no time is called a [Dirac pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function).
- Venus' atmosphere is 90 Earth atmospheres' worth of pressure. [Most of the probes sent there imploded in midair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5KV3rzuag).
- GPS does not triangulate, says reddit man, it [trilaterates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration). Trilateration does not involve the measurement of angles. "Where the signals overlap is where you are."
- "Gravity warps spacetime", meaning [it figuratively warps the axes on which we make measurements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I). An apple thrown up falls down can be considered travelling linearly upward at a constant speed, had there not been a gravity distortion of spacetime.
- A preferred rotation of planets came about when [all the planets going the other way got destroyed by the planets that go the other way](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg). Whichever direction with more planets wins.
- The larger the opening of a vacuum cleaner, the more powerful the suction is, according to Mythbusters.
- Sound travels 5x faster in water, but [more quietly](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5qcr3p/-/dcy9qcn), so you rarely hear anything unless it was loud.
- "Triangular sails allow ships to sail into the wind as well as with it." - How It's Made episode about sails
- CT scans are still X ray.
- It is impossible to exceed the speed of light in a vacuum, but it is possible to exceed the speed of light in water, which is about 0.75c. [When electrons do that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation) in a nuclear reactor, a blue glow is emitted.
- "Fun fact, in space fuses don't work well because there is no gravity for the melted bit to fall away, so they continue to transmit electricity until the fuse metal boils away or the equipment fails."
- Centripetal force is the force acting on the center. Centrifugal force is the force acting outward on the flying object.
- The [Boomerang Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_Nebula) is the coolest thing in the universe. Not Pokemon.
- ["False vacuum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum) refers to the theory that the current space is just a local minimum of energy, rather than the global minimum of energy, and that a random event might instantly turn the universe into one with a lower energy, destroying the current one.
- If a bridge is [wavering about because of the people on it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gQK21572oSU&feature=youtu.be), then the people will try to adjust their stride to the movement, making the situation even worse.
- A knuckle ball moves erratically because [it _isn't_ spinning](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/50cg2n/hi_my_name_is_jack_im_14_years_old_and_i_love/d72zdj3).
- [Superluminal communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superluminal_communication) (communicating instantly through quantum entanglement) is believed to be impossible because, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, it could be used to [transmit information into the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone).
- Running in the rain: given `total rain rate = (rate from top * seconds outdoors) + (rate from side * seconds walking)`, you get less wet if you stand still from time A to time B, and less wet if you run from point A to point B.
- Space movies almost never depict explosions correctly. [There is no fire (or very little of it)](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/90gkle/exploding_model_ships_cotton_balls_leds/e2qf461/), the fragments would travel at the same speed as the vehicle they came from, and it would quickly extinguish because there is no air.
- To the moon, the Earth is a thing in the sky that stays in position all the time.
- The ISS is set to retire in 2020. [Or 2024. Or 2028. Or...](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+ISS+is+set+to+retire+in)
- The reason [(microwaving your own fucking hand)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcOhd9ikNAw) is bad is because microwaves are primarily absorbed below the skin, thus bypassing the nerves. [You could be literally cooking your muscles without ever realizing it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/holdmybeaker/comments/3z2uoj/hmb_while_i_microwave_my_hand/cyiur98)
- String theory, integrating gravity with the point-in-space ["standard model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), is theoretically sound. [In 10-dimensional space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU). Maybe [it doesn't even make sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape).
- 75% of the mass of the universe is hydrogen, and 25% helium. The rest are insignificant.
- The fastest object to be propelled by man, apart from trivial things like particles, was a [manhole cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob#Propulsion_of_steel_plate_cap), at 0.02% the speed of light.
- ["...for every breath you take, there's a ... 99% ... chance that you're breathing in at least one molecule of Caesar's farts from his last day alive."](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-breathable-air-on-earth-has-been-part-of-a-fart)
- [Fish are more conductive than fresh water, but salt water is more conductive than fish.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3c3rd7/does_lightning_strike_the_ocean_if_so_does_it/) This makes electroshocking impossible in salt water.
- Infrared cameras, including [one in a phone case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Vc-69M-UWk), can reveal your PIN on any non-metal number pad, including the order of the digits, with 80% accuracy.
- If the temperature gradient is large enough, power can be generated from the gradient using the [seeback effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect#Seebeck_effect), which does not involve boiling water and turning a turbine.
- Ultrasonic mosquito repellants [do not work](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20669080).
- The event horizon is where escape velocity equals the speed of light. The photon sphere is where orbital velocity equals the speed of light.
- UV light doesn't kill anything unless the light is applied for at least 10 seconds. The light also needs to be [UV-C](https://ultraviolet.com/what-is-germicidal-ultraviolet/), the wavelengths that kill germs.
- A planet gets tidally locked, as a matter of fact, if it's too close to a star. Because, you know, the water is pulled towards the star. So you can't just look for Earth-like planets near the right temperature---[you need to look for the right size of star as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone#Spectral_types_and_star-system_characteristics).
- How fast a plane travels west/east depends on the wind direction, which is [not always faster from east to west](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/40-our-solar-system/the-earth/climate-and-weather/68-why-do-airplanes-take-longer-to-fly-west-than-east-intermediate).
- [Microwaving a half-cut piece of grape](https://www.minds.com/blog/view/177271/grape-microwave-and-pyrex) yields plasma.
- [The 'speed of gravity' is the same as the speed of light.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2nukm0/which_is_faster_gravity_or_light/) If the sun goes away, we also have 8 minutes (ish) of time before we are affected gravitationally.
- No free (Android) app corrects fisheye images because [it's hard](https://www.lonelyspeck.com/defish/).
- By detecting the Earth's mass, magnetic field strength, and earthquake data, scientists conclude that the center of the Earth is made of solid iron, with liquid iron surrounding it.
- We do not have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the moon. Even if we do, the moon would just clump back into a moon-size chunk.
- [Why does light travel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/22pi7o/eli5_why_does_light_travel) Because **spacetime** is a two-dimensional vector of a set length; an object can travel through space and time. In photons' case, they travel entirely through space, and not at all through time (which gives the impression that nothing can ever be "faster" than light). For ordinary, massive objects, they mainly travel through time.
- Snowflakes can in fact [be alike](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/science/who-ever-said-no-two-snowflakes-were-alike.html); the major factor is air turbulence, which can be controlled.
- [The HyperLoop doesn't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNFesa01llk) because the vacuum required is never going to be happen with all the stupid people around. (Imagine a loser poking a hole in the loop and everyone is screwed, or a dude throwing a stone into a turbine or something)
- Steam can be used to light things on fire, simply by the definition of "steam is hot", if something is hot enough.
- Solar eclipses occur [pretty much anywhere](http://nationaleclipse.com/maps/images/map_usa_21stcentury.png) on the map. Any curvature. Any direction. Toronto might see one in 2024.
- [At least two solar and two lunar eclipses happen every year](https://www.android.com/eclipse/), but most of them are not spectacular enough to be called eclipses.
- The [Roche (Rosh) Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit) is the radius at which a large body can tear a smaller body apart, due to the effect of tidal forces on the smaller body.
- The answer to the question, ["immovable objects (a=0) vs unstoppable force (v=constant, so a=0)..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA), is "they are possible only if they pass right through each other".
- **Infrared thermometers** are (typically) calibrated for an emissivity of 0.95. If you use one on a material with a lower emissivity, it'll give inaccurate readings. This can be cheaply solved by sticking a piece of electrical tape on the surface, and measuring that.
- From a photon's perspective, [it takes exactly no time to travel from its source to its destination](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/30/how-do-photons-experience-time/#78392c93278d), no matter where the destination is. Even if something is a thousand lightyears away.

- [Ultrasonic welding](http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/ultrasonic-welding-2.gif) uses ultrasound to heat up and weld two adjacent pieces of metal together. [Microsoft pulled that dick move once.](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Laptop+Teardown/92915)
- The Sun undergoes spontaneous magnetic reversals every 9–12 years, where it increases in field strength.
- Pluto's satellite [Charon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_%28moon%29) is massive enough to significantly affect pluto's center of orbit.
- A [5-gram black hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ&list=UUsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q&index=38) will emit enough hawking radiation to kill everyone around you (450TJ, like a nuclear bomb).
- ["Optical bonding"](http://slideplayer.com/slide/3399128/), à la filling the air gap(s) with special glue, makes your screens reflect less.
- On most bikes, [the pedals never move backwards with respect to the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72DCj3BztG4), except if the lowest gear is chosen, in which case it _might_ be possible.
- The more alien life we find, the more likely it is for the great filter to be [ahead of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjtOGPJ0URM), something that destroys all civilisations. Us not finding any alien life means _we might have passed the great filter_.
- _Why_ [dark mode is less easy to read and causes eye strain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCaFRN3aaP8) _long term_: eyes are dilated when viewing light text on dark backgrounds, making it hard and taking more energy to focus (think large aperture cameras). Bright text also scatters light, bleeding light onto the dark background. This does not happen on black on white screens. The best contrast for _reading_ is white on dark blue. If you don't stare at your screen for hours, none of this matters.
- You can make a huge natural snowball only near the belt where the temperature is fluctuating close to 0°C.
- A solar eclipse looks like a [vague dark spot](http://time.com/4908949/total-solar-eclipse-space-view/) from space.
- You don't [pump air into your own scuba gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZYWO0ylFoQ) because (a) it's hard, and (b) the pump adds oils and lubricants into the air you breathe.
- The looping time machine episode of Futurama, where Fry _et al._ travel to the same universe after the universe dies and recreates itself, came from [the Big Bounce theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bounce).
- The sun's diameter is pretty close to 400 times that of the moon's (400.5).
- Voyager I is analogue. It takes pictures like a fax machine, and sends them back like a radio.
- In 2015, the definition of a parsec changed from "the distance at which one astronomical unitsubtends an angle of one arcsecond" to "648000/π astronomical units", which is about 3.26 light-years.
- When a helicopter or quadcopter descends vertically, (according to /u/eaterofdog) the vehicle may lose lift to the phenomenon called "prop wash". However, when researched online, prop wash seems to generate a leftward torque, rather than a downward force.
- Lightyear to meter conversion is easy, if you know a lightyear is 9.461E15 meters, and then you just approximate it as 1E16 meters.
- [The Earth is a dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal), so its field strength depends on [how aligned the two poles are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#/media/File%3ANASA_54559main_comparison1_strip.gif). If they are not aligned, the field strength is low, and may even be reversed.
- The moon is the largest natural satellite relative to the planet's size. This is not hard to achieve, considering mercury has no moons, venus has no moons, ~~and Mars has no moons either~~.
- An [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere) is a coulomb per second. All of them are considered SI units.
