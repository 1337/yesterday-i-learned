1. The Vatican ruled that [their daily bread must contain at least some gluten](https://www.rt.com/viral/395810-gluten-free-holy-bread/), just as their wine must be made from unsoured grapes, both for reasons they can probably explain.
1. The [Criterion of embarrassment][wikipedia 129] says that the author (God/Jesus) wouldn't write something embarrassing about himself, therefore the Bible's accounts are probably true.
1. God didn't tell anyone to ["be fruitful and multiply"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_mandate) when the Earth had seven bilion people in it.
1. The Bible never says how many wise men there were.

1. Adam in the bible did not have the largest penis on Earth at any given time.
1. "Judas Iscariot hung himself and all the guts fell out" was reconstructed from "He died by hanging" and "he fell headlong; his bowels gushed out". [They may be independent/contradictory/non-contradictory events](https://carm.org/bible-difficulties/matthew-mark/how-did-judas-die-hanging-or-falling-down).
1. An upside-down cross is either [a petrine cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Saint_Peter), i.e. Peter's cross, because he was said to have been crucified upside down, or an anti-christianity symbol, depending on context.
1. Naomi is Ruth's mother in law in the bible. One of the things she said was "Do not call me Naomi, call me Mara, ..."
1. Abraham and God talked often before he tried to sacrifice his son. After the event, God sent an angel down instead, "and Abraham's fortune takes a downward turn."1. [*Immaculate conception*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception) refers to Mary being born sin-free, not the virgin birth of Jesus.
1. The [Jesus fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys) has a special name *ichthys*, which is not special once you realise that's the Greek word for fish.
1. Anabaptism is adult baptism.
1. The word Christ is derived from the Greek Χριστός (Christos), which is a translation of the Hebrew משיח (Meshiakh), meaning the "anointed", and usually transliterated into English as "Messiah". It is not part of Jesus' name.
1. On at least one occasion, [God told two bears to maul 42 boys to death](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-24.htm), so it is within reason that God wants (some) people to die.
1. There are two James and two Simons apostles.
1. [God definitely pulled an Anakin](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-killed-them-all) in 1 Samuel 15: ["Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15&version=NIV)
1. Genesis 7:2 clearly says there are *seven* pairs of clean animals.
1. [The disciple whom Jesus loved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved) is not his wife like some moron said on Youtube. Jesus has no wife.
1. The bible never said no to cannibalism. It more often said "do not murder", while never ruling out human sacrifice (Genesis 22). Since humans are neither shellfish nor hoofed, apart from superstition, the bible never really ruled out consumption of anyone who died in a way that drained out their own blood.
1. God sends good and evil to us without respect to our righteousness [in the book of Job], said a [chill dude](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6yi7n0/white_christians_are_now_a_minority_of_the_us/dmoap3c/?context=3).
1. "As a non religious individual I often consider the fact that a 'god' may very well exist, but considering the scope of both power and persuasion an individual of a god calibre would employ, it would be reasonable to assume that such an entity would view us as interesting and important as you would a single celled organism."
1. The story of Egyptian deity [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus) shares some common traits with the story of Jesus (rising from the dead and stuff), but scholars reject the association between the two.1. *John* (Yehohanan) means "Yahweh is Gracious"; *Jonathan* (Yonatan) means "JHVH has given". They are not the same name (but *Johnny* is). If you plan to name your child a variant of John, Jonathan is best left for when you have been expecting, but you are on a low sperm count.
1. Amos, Isaiah (parts), Hosea, and Micah (parts) are the [first books written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible). Genesis wasn't written for another 300 years. See link for other dates.
1. Jesus drank wine, but people in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints must abstain. The Quran only prohibited grape-based alcohol, but [the lawmakers interpret this is a total ban on alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication#Religious_views).
1. "[The 10 Plagues in Exodus are all attacks on Egyptian gods.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9346j9/what_is_something_most_people_dont_know_about_the/e3aw2w6/) For example, turning the Nile to blood: The Nile was a god to the Egyptians, and then turning it to blood was imagery of killing said god. Frogs were also considered gods, and when frogs were going flipping everywhere (plague 6 or something), Egyptians would be horrified to step on one of their gods. Similar to the Nile, when God cast darkness upon Egypt, it was like killing the sun (Egyptian god Ra)." - /u/Azaziah
1. Cain and Abel [clearly](https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm) had another brother called Seth, but no one mentions him.
