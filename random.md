1. The reason you wake up at the middle of the night after heavy drinking: alcohol does not turn into any kind of sugar. In fact, alcohol tends to induce a hypoglycemic state, which is hypothesized to be one of the reasons that drinking on an empty stomach tends to make you more inebriated--a lot of the signs of low blood sugar mimic alcohol intoxication. This is because when alcohol is metabolized, it passes off some of its chemical energy to a compound called NAD, reducing it to NADH, which the cell uses for metabolic purposes. However, when alcohol floods the liver with NADH, the relative amount of NAD available is fairly low, and this molecule is required for several of the reactions of gluconeogenesis, which is the process by which the liver creates glucose in between meals. Hence, alcohol on an empty stomach can cause low blood glucose by inhibiting the livers ability to perform gluconeogenesis. It also never acts as a "stimulant" in any way. It is eventually metabolized to acetic acid, which is not a stimulant.

1. According to Crockford, Netscape called it LiveScript, originally. In their attempt to 'destroy Microsoft', they teamed up with Sun. One of Sun's original goals with Java was making it the client-side scripting language for the browser. However, Netscape had LiveScript. Apparently the negotiations almost broke down over this point. In an enlightened moment, (probably) Marc Andreessen proposed renaming LiveScript to JavaScript (despite the fact that the languages have very little in common), and joy was had. Sun got the JavaScript trademark (and passed it on to Oracle), and Netscape got a perpetual exclusive license to use it. When JavaScript was standardized to avoid Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, Netscape refused to share its license, and so the official language was renamed to ECMAScript, after the standards body. When Sun was bought by Oracle, it also got the trademark, and presumably, Mozilla inherited the exclusive license from Netscape.
