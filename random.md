* The reason you wake up at the middle of the night after heavy drinking: alcohol does not turn into any kind of sugar. In fact, alcohol tends to induce a hypoglycemic state, which is hypothesized to be one of the reasons that drinking on an empty stomach tends to make you more inebriated--a lot of the signs of low blood sugar mimic alcohol intoxication. This is because when alcohol is metabolized, it passes off some of its chemical energy to a compound called NAD, reducing it to NADH, which the cell uses for metabolic purposes. However, when alcohol floods the liver with NADH, the relative amount of NAD available is fairly low, and this molecule is required for several of the reactions of gluconeogenesis, which is the process by which the liver creates glucose in between meals. Hence, alcohol on an empty stomach can cause low blood glucose by inhibiting the livers ability to perform gluconeogenesis. It also never acts as a "stimulant" in any way. It is eventually metabolized to acetic acid, which is not a stimulant.

* According to Crockford, Netscape called it LiveScript, originally. In their attempt to 'destroy Microsoft', they teamed up with Sun. One of Sun's original goals with Java was making it the client-side scripting language for the browser. However, Netscape had LiveScript. Apparently the negotiations almost broke down over this point. In an enlightened moment, (probably) Marc Andreessen proposed renaming LiveScript to JavaScript (despite the fact that the languages have very little in common), and joy was had. Sun got the JavaScript trademark (and passed it on to Oracle), and Netscape got a perpetual exclusive license to use it. When JavaScript was standardized to avoid Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, Netscape refused to share its license, and so the official language was renamed to ECMAScript, after the standards body. When Sun was bought by Oracle, it also got the trademark, and presumably, Mozilla inherited the exclusive license from Netscape.

You'd think free housing is awesome right? Wrong. Since you live in a company monitored neighbourhood and go to work pretty much next door. You have to apply for permission to leave. An employee killed herself a couple years ago because she wasn't allowed to leave and hadn't seen her parents for years.
* Given the high quality and low overall cost of [YKK zippers](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/branded/2012/04/ykk_zippers_why_so_many_designers_use_them_.html), clothing companies use that brand because it is among the last things they choose to skimp out.

* In Europe, if you ask for "water", bottled water will be served by default, costing more than other beverages. Always ask for "tap water", or, preferably, "tap water, out of a tap, in a glass, not a bottle, the free kind, the kind I can get for zero Euros".
* Many modern tank barrels are no longer rifled (riffled? spiral grooves.), because they shoot different types of ordnance that would be damaged by the rifling, such as HEAT rounds.

* [Datura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura) makes you delirious, not high.
* During the early Empire, Roman tastes preferred a sweet, strong wine. Keep in mind that this would not be a strong drink by modern standards. Wine maxes out at around 15% ABV; any more alcohol than that and it kills the yeast, stopping any further fermentation. And the Romans, for all their advances, never discovered distillation. So, wine would have been the most alcoholic drink they knew. They rarely drank it straight, which was seen as uncultured and boorish. They watered it down, usually at a ratio of two parts water to one part wine. They also added other ingredients—honey to mask the acidity of wine turning to vinegar, and herbs, spices, resin, and even sea water to cut the sweetness.
