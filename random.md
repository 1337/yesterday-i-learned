The major selling point is the client defines the structure of the data that the server returns, so it always gets what it wants. The major disadvantage is, well, if the client can make calls like that, then the server can't cache these results efficiently.
- On using assertions on production: ["(A good) approach is to leave the assertions in the code when you ship, and to automatically file a bug report on behalf of the end user and perhaps to try to re-start the application every time an assertion fails. At that same startup I mentioned above I had a boss who insisted that we not do this. I pointed out to him that an assertion failure meant that something in the program was very wrong and that it was likely that the program would produce the wrong result. ... *He said it was more important that the company avoid the appearance of having done something wrong than that we stop before producing an incorrect result.* I left the company."](https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf) Takeaway: write assertions when assertions will do, and unit tests when assertions will not.

- Build your software with three kinds of user interfaces. One, with the fewest buttons, to end users. Another one, with all buttons, for you (the developer). Finally, the one for operations and administrators that aren't you: NSA, the Russian government, whatever, to make sure they can do their jobs.
- "[If you want to reduce your test mass, the number one thing you should do is look at the tests that have never failed in a year (and the code hasn't been touched in the same year) and consider throwing them away.](https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf) They are producing no information for you — or at least very little information. The value of the information they produce may not be worth the expense of maintaining and running the tests. This is the first set of tests to throw away — whether they are unit tests, integration tests, or system tests."
- Betty Crocker is not a real person. Betty Crocker was the General Mills marketing department.
- The 及第 in [及第粥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%8F%8A%E7%AC%AC%E7%B2%A5) came from 雜底 rather than [進士及第](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BF%9B%E5%A3%AB%E5%8F%8A%E7%AC%AC). 進士 meant you're among the top 3 *classes* (一、二、三甲) in the central government entrance exam, 及第 meant you were selected, and 進士及第 meant you were one of the three people *among* 一甲 who was selected. As an aside, 進士出身 means you were in 二甲, 同進士出身 means you were in 三甲, and the name of the congee has almost nothing to do with the examination system.

- The largest submarine is [175m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdy0gBVWAzE), which is far longer (and wider) than the Boeing 747-400, at 71m.
- Submarines can't use GPS... submarines use sonar. But sonar tells enemies their location. So they just guess with inertia. Submarines also can't get internet... so they use VLF radio instead, where they can receive limited information at 700 words per minute.
- [Half of all large ships are registered in panama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7CvEt51fz4), because taxation is so low. An international ship follows the laws of its country, as long as it is outside any other country's territorial waters (12 miles from the coast).
- A [philosophical razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor) is called that because it "shaves off" unlikely explanations for something. [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) says simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones, [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) says someone doing bad things to you is probably being stupid instead of being mean, and [Newton's flaming laser sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder#Newton's_flaming_laser_sword) says that, if an argument cannot be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worthy arguing about.

- _Why_ [dark mode is less easy to read and causes eye strain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCaFRN3aaP8) _long term_: eyes are dilated when viewing light text on dark backgrounds, making it hard and taking more energy to focus (think large aperture cameras). Bright text also scatters light, bleeding light onto the dark background. This does not happen on black on white screens. The best contrast for _reading_ is white on dark blue. If you don't stare at your screen for hours, none of this matters.
- Since it takes fuel to carry fuel, [each plane has a sweet spot where it uses the least fuel per unit distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUomfuWuA8). In that video, they quoted 2000 miles for some plane.
- [Load testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing) measures stability under reasonable load (to determine the quality of service over various loads).

- [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). Increasing efficiency in anything (like cars with better fuel economy) somehow increases overall usage (like, more people driving because it's efficient). To reduce overall environmental impact, simply increasing efficiency does not work, "however, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising".

- A "unit" is a file or module containing a set of related functions, not a single function. You don't need a new test case for every function unless you work at JPL. You can assert multiple times in a test. Don't go crazy. But most importantly, [untested Code Is Broken by Definition](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/write-professional-unit-tests-in-python--cms-25835).

- UK is in [no-deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agZ0xISi40E) Brexit position because it basically wants complete autonomy in its jurisdiction (no free movement of people, goods, financial contribution to the union, and trade policies), which is not a thing even for the most basic EU partners, like Turkey.
- Firefox OS failed not because it didn't solve a problem, but because it didn't solve _its users' problem_. It failed because the people who would buy Firefox OS are all geeks, and the rest of the population cares about price, not how open the web is.
- Interest in [Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_%28software%29), Jenkins' predecessor, collapsed because Oracle wanted to trademark "Hudson". [Other reasons to hate Oracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2e2c1o/what_do_we_hate_oracle_for/cjvewbi/): Buying Java with the sole purpose to sue Google for money, burning MySQL so people move to Oracle DB, only allowing fortune 500 companies to contribute to OpenOffice, closing source for Solaris so OpenSolaris can no longer be built.
- You are supposed to test _just_ the function in a unit test, mocking everything except that function. Assuming [your language has no concept of interfaces](https://sendgrid.com/blog/when-writing-unit-tests-dont-use-mocks/), if you have a function call inside a function, and your unit test does not mock out anything, then you're doing something wrong.
- The Russian [Skoptsy people](http://ezinetime.net/skoptsy-people-members-of-an-old-russian-cult-that-practiced-the-removal-of-all-sexual-organs/) practiced the removal of _all_ sexual organs. It is unclear how the people reproduced.

- [ETOPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSxSgbNQi-g) certification is a number of minutes under which an aircraft can continue flying (to a diversion/emergency airport) when one of the two engines (specifically for twin-engine aircraft) fails. Before ETOPS existed, planes must have three or four engines to cross the Atlantic, making many flight paths economically infeasible.

Tiny chunks they collect afterwards are sold in tea bags, but it doesn't mean it's bad, it just means the flavour comes out quicker because the surface area is greater, and the flavour is not as nuanced.
- Both the [White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW6hxlThB_o) and the [Buckingham Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOFMqBxJPAA) have a room with "China" in its name (China room / China luncheon room).

- [Launching multiple brands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVHYcLV-H0A) lets a business target completely different audiences.

- [Only racers near the back get blue shells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFfga8-3SZI). The blue shell is a homing missile that aims for the racer in the first place. It is therefore an equaliser (for casual players) that makes sure everyone is relatively close together. Its blast radius is designed to hit many players near the first racer. If you can't avoid the blue shell, the best thing you can do is to brake and hope the blast radius also hits the racer in second place.
- Companies want to [turn their brands into household names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness), but not so much that it turns into the product category itself. See: [Nintendo calling their products "videogame consoles" to make sure "Nintendo" is not what they're making](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ah9wsh/til_nintendo_pushed_the_term_videogame_console_so/), and [Velcro calling their things "hook and loops"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRi8LptvFZY) so "Velcro" remains the name for the real deal.
- The [500 rule of astrophotography](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) (i.e. taking photos of stars): if you keep your shutter open for too long, stars will start to trail and look bad. Use _500 Divided By the Focal Length of Your Lens (in mm) = The Longest Exposure (in Seconds) Before Stars Start to “Trail”_. If you have a 24mm lens, then 500/24 says you can only open your shutter for 20 seconds. Note: [focal length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length) is not the [focal point/distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_%28optics%29), which can be infinity.

- China builds so many high speed trains because they have the political will to. China built a money-losing high-speed railway into Xinjiang to [promote ethnic unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JDoll8OEFE), i.e. bring the place closer to Beijing so the region can be controlled. They did the exact same thing with Hong Kong, except at least it makes financial sense. Some Hong Kong people don't like it because there is now a spot inside the Hong Kong station that is part of China, violating the autonomy promised by the Basic Law.
- According to the anime, shellder changes shape [when the snowpoke wants to evolve](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:Slowking_evolution_anime.png).
- SSDs with [quad level cells](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13752/anandtech-year-in-review-2018-ssds) now exist.

- Alcantara is a microfibre material manufactured by a company called Alcantara.
- [Princple of flag design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4): keep it simple. A flag should be so simple that even a child can draw it from memory. Use a standard set of colours, red white blue... blablabla and black. **Never use words or lettering of any kind.** Draw your design on a one-inch canvas. If it doesn't fit, it's no good.
- No one ever said proposals need to be a surprise. The moment you start asking for ring sizes, she would have already known something's up.
- [One-way plane tickets more expensive than return tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72hlr-E7KA0): flight companies want to price their trips as competitive as possible (assuming competition exists). So they make price brackets to lower some ticket prices, and raise some others to make up for the lower fares. They raise prices business travellers, who can pay more, to offset the cheaper tickets sold to holiday goers, who pay for their own tickets and are more budget-conscious. They use "price discrimination", aka pricing rules, to make sure "business-like" trips are charged more. Business trips don't have a "minimum stay" period, because business people travel for just a few days and return. When they do that, they also introduce a problematic case where they can't calculate how long your stay is when you book one-way... so it's just half the price of a business-like return trip, rather than the price of a holiday-like trip.
- When someone asks you "how much do we need to scale?", you need an answer based on two things you need to know: the number of additional users, and % extra load per user.
- The g in [gRPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC) stands for gRPC, because that's how **g**oogle names things.
- [ISO 8601 week dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) are prefixed with a `W`, so `2018-W52` is the last week of the year. Note: these are ISO year and week numbers.

- Recipe delivery packages like HelloFresh and Blue Apron [have a gross amount of packaging waste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGK86tWMFjk), even excluding the box and the ice packs: recipe paper, insulation, boxes in boxes, thicker bags for vegetables, a separate bag for two olives...
- You're supposed to use a stack for checking whether a bunch of brackets match up with each other correctly. Alternatively, if you are skilled, prove that a `count('[') == count(']')` check is sufficient if the string starts with `[` and ends with `]`.

There is no numeric "score" yet, though, just a blacklist.
- Summing up [modern web development](https://www.sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer): JS being required by default means it is overused, and used for the wrong things. "Yes, it's technically amazing to ... have your JS build a content page, but it's utterly over-engineered and impractical for most occasions (where HTML should be served as HTML)." Requiring JS to serve a page means the robustness goes missing, since users can disable JS. Also: developers make pages like everyone has unlimited fast Internet.
- Reusable "cling film" can be made with beeswax.

- ["Senior developers are experts in their chosen technology stacks. They are given the hard tasks (the ones nobody knows how to solve) and often get design responsibilties. They often work independently because they have a proven track record of delivering the goods. They are expected to mentor Junior and intermediate developers. Often they are amazing troubleshooters. They have run into those same problems before and have a very good idea of where to look first. Seniors often mentor outside the workplace as well. They generally have at least ten years of experience and have almost always been on at least one death march and know exactly why some things are to be avoided. They know how to deliver a working product and meet a deadline. They know what corners can be cut and what corners should never be cut. They know at least one and often several languages at the expert level. They have seen a lot of "hot new technologies" hit the workplace and disappear, so they tend to be a bit more conservative about jumping on the bandwagon for the next exciting new development tool (but not completely resistant to change - those would be the older Intermediate developers who never make the leap to Senior). They understand their job is to deliver working software that does what the users want, not to play with fun tools. They are often pickier about where they will work because they can be and because they have seen first hand how bad some places can be. They seek out the places that have the most interesting tasks to do. Often they know more about their company's products than anyone else even if they have been there only a few months. They know they need more than programming knowledge and are good at getting knowledge about the business domain they support as well. They are often aware of issues that juniors never consider and intermediates often don't think about such as regulatory and legal issues in the business domain they support. They can and will push back a requirement because they know what the problems with it will be and can explain the same to the laymen." - HLGEM](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/14972/116811)

- The reason you wake up at the middle of the night after heavy drinking: alcohol does not turn into any kind of sugar. In fact, alcohol tends to induce a hypoglycemic state, which is hypothesized to be one of the reasons that drinking on an empty stomach tends to make you more inebriated--a lot of the signs of low blood sugar mimic alcohol intoxication. This is because when alcohol is metabolized, it passes off some of its chemical energy to a compound called NAD, reducing it to NADH, which the cell uses for metabolic purposes. However, when alcohol floods the liver with NADH, the relative amount of NAD available is fairly low, and this molecule is required for several of the reactions of gluconeogenesis, which is the process by which the liver creates glucose in between meals. Hence, alcohol on an empty stomach can cause low blood glucose by inhibiting the livers ability to perform gluconeogenesis. It also never acts as a "stimulant" in any way.
