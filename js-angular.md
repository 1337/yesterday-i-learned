(Angular 2+)

- [Angular "zones"](https://github.com/angular/zone.js/) are actually inspired by [Dart's zones](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.3.0/dart-async/Zone-class.html). "A zone represents an environment that remains stable across asynchronous calls." "You can think of it as thread-local storage for JavaScript VMs." tl;dr: _it's an execution context_. [`zone.run()` is equivalent to the old `$digest()`.](https://medium.com/@MertzAlertz/what-the-hell-is-zone-js-and-why-is-it-in-my-angular-2-6ff28bcf943e).
- [Only classes marked as `@Injectable()` can be services](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).
- You don't make a service by hand. You make a service by calling [`ionic generate service foo/bar`](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/generate) or the underlying [`ng generate service foo/bar`](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-first-ionic-4-app-with-api-calls-f6ea747dc17a). See what else you can generate by running `npx ng g --help`.
- A "component" is what was once a controller, handling views and stuff. Actually, the concept of a component already existed in AngularJS 1.5. [A "module" is a collection of component, services, directives, and so on](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52138193/1558430), which is the same as the original definition.
- Behold new template syntax. `{{ interpolation }}`. [`[oneWayBinding]="expression"`](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#binding-syntax-an-overview) (you can also use `bind-oneWayBinding="expression"` if you think brackets are dumb.) `(event)="handler"` (you can also use `on-event="handler"` if you think brackets are dumb.) [`[(kindaTwoWayBinding)]="expression"`](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/10/13/two-way-data-binding-in-angular-2.html) (you can also use `bindon-kindaTwoWayBinding="expression"` if you think brackets are dumb.) `*ngFor`: [just some dumb shit you'll have to live with](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35498498/what-is-the-meaning-of-in-ngfor-in-angular2) if the element that contains `ngFor` is not `<template>`. `*ngFor` wraps your thing around one.
- See [two-way data binding](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/components/app_structure/two_way_data_binding.html). It is more work than it was in angular.js.
- Directives that add, remove, or manipulate elements are called [structural directives](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives), and need that `*` in, say, `*ngIf`. Why angular.js did not need that is not well-understood, but this new syntax is considered "syntactic sugar".
