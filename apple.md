1. Your iOS app needs to be approved for *beta testing*.
1. Apple's devices were once named in (incremental update, big update) ways because [AT&T had two-year contracts](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/17/were-keeping-smartphones-longer-and-its-going-to-make-them-crazy-expensive/), so naming those devices like they were major upgrades every two years worked out for both of them.
1. The guy who invented THX, which stands for [Tomlinson Holman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomlinson_Holman) something, went on to work at Apple. Apple's audio quality has been pretty good.
1. [Phil Schiller's grand philosophical theory](http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/schiller-apple-theory/) is, essentially: the job of whichever Apple product that you have closest to you should do more and more things so you don't need to reach for the next closest Apple product so often. In the current case, the Apple Watch does more so you don't need the iPhone so much so you don't need the iPad so much so you don't need the Macbook so much so you don't need the Mac so much. And for the Mac, its job is to challenge what we can do with computers.
1. The iOS launcher is called the [SpringBoard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpringBoard).
1. In the case of product red, since RED is superscripted and also what's trademarked, the actual logo is `(PRODUCT)^(RED^(TM))`, where TM is superscripted twice.
1. So many people use iPhones, that when iOS 7 came out, [its parallax wallpapers caused enough people to get motion sickness to make the news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_7).
1. Macbook Pro fans don't spin up until [the CPU is 81 degrees C.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgeh7ZJRhZU)
1. Animojis work even if the depth sensor is covered. That means the iPhone X isn't even using its unique hardware. That means every iPhone could have gotten this feature. But no, that's not the point. This feature lets your friends know you have an iPhone X.
1. The HomePod exists mainly to keep people who would otherwise buy the Google Home to stay away from Google's ecosystem.
1. [iOS 1 never allowed more than one page of apps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gxa2rq-kL8) It never had an app store so it wasn't a problem.
1. The original iPhone has a recessed headphone jack that allows only Apple-style headphones (the ones with straight jacks that look like a dog dildo) to be plugged in.
1. [iPhone home buttons are digitally signed and paired with the phone that came with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAzfZ0lQJO0). Put it in another iPhone and it will stop working.
1. Apple Park, [a giant donut of doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park#/media/File:Aerial_view_of_Apple_Park_dllu.jpg), replaced 1 Infinite Loop as the headquarters in 2017. The two campuses are just 3km away.
1. [The iPhone 8 Plus has the longest lasting battery (out of all tested flagships)](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Our-iPhone-8-Plus-battery-life-test-reveals-the-best-endurance-from-an-iPhone-yet_id98512), at twice as long of a runtime than your phone, and happens to take twice as long to charge.
1. [There were no CPU touch boost drivers in iOS](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12873/apple-announces-ios-12) until version 12.
1. XCode can give you a bullshit [`-1=ffffffffffffffff
`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44173831/codesign-returned-unknown-error-1-ffffffffffffffff) error just because you didn't unlock your keychain.
1. To clear all your notifications at once, [rage-press the "x"](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-click-wonder-how-to-clear-many-days-of-notifications-on-your-iphone-in-one-tap/) and you will be given the option.
1. To sort your home screen icons alphabetically, [select your icons in reverse alphabetical order](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-quickly-rearrange-your-home-screen-in-ios-11/), with multiple fingers, and then release. This is the only way.
1. On an iPhone, the mute toggle showing red means "mute is on", not "sound is on".
1. Four counts of other manufacturers copying Apple for absolutely no reason whatsoever: headphone jack removal, notch, "AR emojis", [swipe nav gestures](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/05/09/android-ps-gesture-navigation-bad-google/). All occurred in the 2015-2018 range, all half-baked, all worse, with no reasonable person claiming to enjoy any of these things. If Apple were to turn the iPhone into the shape of a dildo, there is a 100% likelihood that at least one other manufacturer will follow.
1. The iPad doesn't have a calculator because [Steve Jobs said no, pull it we can't ship that (stretched-out calculator UI)](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4dlqgv/why_does_ipad_not_have_a_native_calculator/d1s5rr9/).
1. [Apple's vision is to eliminate technology from the user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO0b-l-u7Yk), not to make the best technology for the user. If it means to remove ports (because you need ports only if you think the tech exists), then it *will* remove ports. If making things lighter makes the tech less obvious, then it *will* make products lighter. Apple also believes that customers don't know what they want. Customers asking for a faster horse actually want a car. No customer will ask for the next big thing.
1. The original iPhone had no screws holding the body together. The [pentalobe atrocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_security_screw) was committed first in 2009, on a macbook.
1. [Apple doesn't tweet.](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/3/12781498/apple-twitter-account-paid-tweets) Even if they tweet, they delete the tweets afterwards.
1. Apple originally wanted to use a full apple. But in small print it looked like a cherry. So they added the bite.
1. While you [can](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/wiki/App-Store-FAQ) update your hybrid iOS app remotely and bypassing the app store review process, you cannot ask the user if they want to update.
1. The iPhone 8's resolution is around 720p.
1. iOS apps are [`.ipa`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa) compressed (payload), and `.app` uncompressed.
1. `xcode-select --print-path` gives you where Xcode is installed.
1. `xcodebuild -list -project ???.xcodeproj` tells you what the Xcode project is configured to build, and information like targets and schemes.
1. Adding `build` after that command, i.e. `xcodebuild -project ???.xcodeproj build`, builds the `.app`.
1. "Archive" means "Compile", and "Compile" means something else, and "Build" means neither of the three.
1. iOS app submission requires one screenshot for each screen size your app claims to support.
1. [You cannot install IPAs on the simulator](https://stackoverflow.com/a/517541/1558430) (if it is built for a different CPU architecture).
1. [Why would you pay for a phone made by Google? "You paid for a phone so Google can sell you to advertisers."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianmorris/2017/02/10/how-google-blew-it-with-the-pixel-and-pixel-xl/#3a1ca730f3f6) This is not the case for Apple.
1. Force touch is more basic; [3D touch](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/what-is-the-difference-between-apple-iphone-3d-touch-and-force-touch/) is more granular. [It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Touch#3D_Touch) would appear that iPhones have 3D touch, and all other "trackpad devices" have force touch.
1. According to EverythingApplePro, [Apple releases things on Tuesdays and starts preorders on Fridays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=norgCJzrNb4).
1. The Apple A10X chip is the first TSMC 10nm chip to be used by a consumer device.
1. "Mercury" is the Firefox for iOS.
1. There is normally no way to [transfer a file using Bluetooth](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18884705/transfer-data-between-ios-and-android-via-bluetooth) on iOS. Get a Mac.
1. Chrome for iOS makes requests to `http://localhost:0` for [URL verification][newrelic].
1. "A [provisioning profile](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/migrating_code_signing.html#introduction-to-code-signing) is a plist file that is cryptographically signed by Apple's CA to ensure it cannot be modified after being created. This allows Apple to have complete control over the deployment mechanism that is used on iOS."
1. [WKWebView](http://blog.initlabs.com/post/100113463211/wkwebview-vs-uiwebview) uses less CPU for WebGL-related tasks on iOS.
1. The iPhone 6s is 0.3mm thicker than the iPhone 6 (for the force touch rubbish). Their casings are not interchangeable.
1. Depending on your device, Tim decided it would be nice if you get totally different UI on it, depending on which one it is. Swiping up on the iPhone gets you the control center, and on the iPad, it is a dock instead.
1. "iPhone X is top notch lol"
1. The new Siri knows its birthday (around 2011) but won't answer how old it is. Therefore, Siri is a woman.
1. The iOS source code contained "vim turds" [at some point](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/commit/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927#diff-a084b794bc0759e7a6b77810e01874f2L6).
1. "2007: home button always takes you home, no matter where you are (mentioned in keynote). 2017: home button takes you home most of the time if you press it once. Press it twice and you get an app switcher. Press it three times for accessibility. If your phone is locked, press it once to wake, twice to bring up passcode. If you're in a notification, press once to get rid of notification, then again to go home. Rest finger to unlock without opening home. Double rest to bring reachability. Press and hold for Siri. Press and hold longer for Siri with stop on release." - /u/atalkingfish
1. CarrotPop makes an iPhone app, called ["Send Me to Heaven"](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/send-me-to-heaven-throw-phone-apple_n_3720888), that scores how high you throw the phone into the air. The app was banned.
1. The Safari responsive design mode straight out [denies other ecosystems exist](http://imgur.com/TYfG7DN).
1. When you take an elevator ride with Steve Jobs and tell him what you do, results may vary. You either [get fired](https://www.quora.com/Who-did-Steve-Jobs-actually-fire-in-an-elevator), or [you don't](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6wsmub/did_steve_jobs_make_much_smalltalk_with_his/) ("That's what I heard. I hope it gets better.") It depends on what you say (said).
