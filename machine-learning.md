## Unsupervised machine learning (UML)

Unsupervised machine learning is used to find patterns in data. Data is unlabelled. Examples of UML include K-means, hierarchical clustering, and max entropy.

### K-means

K-means is a good first-round for understanding the structure of data. Given a number of clusters (K), it will group your data into this many clusters. How much the clusters make sense depends on you.

## Supervised machine learning (SML)

Supervised machine learning is used to predict things. Data is labelled before it is fed into an algorithm. After training, SML can be used to make certain guesses, like whether an image contains a bird. Examples of UML include regression and classification.

*Without a correct model, a machine cannot predict anything [useful].*

### Classification

Classification is the act of applying the right label(s) to a given input. Naive Bayes Classifiers, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks (Neuralnets) all belong to classification.
