Or, if you are an optimist, you may find your chance of dying from cocaine alone at most 1/18 as likely as this cocaethylene thing.
1. [/u/SimplyOriginal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/2quas2/weed_as_a_party_drug/cn9ncl8/) posts about maximising alcohol's per-unit potential: *Eat [fatty foods and carbs] 45mins before your first drink [to] slow down the absorption rate. Maintain a [steady] increase of [BAC]. Stick to one type of alcohol [to maintain the feel-good effects. Do not] hammer shots.*
1. Cocaine stops being detectable in fluids after a few days.
1. Lasers burn away rust, but not with the iron underneath, because rust absorbs more light than iron.
1. (Throwback Wednesday) Buffer solutions can only be made from [weak acids](http://chemcollective.org/activities/tutorials/buffers/buffers3) (and their conjugate bases). When a strong acid is added, the conjugate base neutralises it. When a strong base is added, the acid protonates, neutralising the base. In both cases, the pH did not change much.
1. Aluminium cookware can potentially add [1~2mg](http://www.livestrong.com/article/475155-health-risks-of-cooking-in-aluminum/) of it to your diet per day. The upper limit is 85mg. Better safe than sorry.
1. The [pH of urine](https://www.rnceus.com/ua/uaph.html) can vary wildly from 4.5 to 8. It correlates to whatever pH your body is, which can be low (dehydration) or high (crazy illnesses, see link).
1. [Oxalic acid](https://www.livescience.com/56237-why-spinach-makes-teeth-feel-weird.html) is the cause of spinach making your teeth feel funny. Too much (now calcium oxalate) in your kidneys become kidney stones.
1. Henna is light brown. There is no such thing as black henna. [Black henna is P-Phenylenediamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Phenylenediamine), which is a banned skin irritant (for henna).
1. Microscopic glass cracks get bigger as you drop the phone more often.
1. [Hands rely on keratin softening from moisture from sweat to improve grip.](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/09/19/1706233114.full)
1. Aluminium is recycled by passing currents through it, which makes it temporarily magnetic.
1. Salt and vinegar chips are "artificially flavored". They are sprinkled with sodium acetate, which conveys the flavors of salt and vinegar while not technically being either.
1. In Jurassic World, two children save themselves by fixing a 20-year old Jeep. Trouble is, gas doesn't last that long, and nowhere does the scene show gasoline.
1. [Rate law][youtube 18]: "Zeroth order" (`kA^0`, i.e. rate is constant `k`), "First order" (`kA^1`, i.e. doubling concentration doubles the rate), "Second order" (`kA^2`, i.e. more sensitive to rate than first order)
1. It takes the same amount of energy to melt ice (from 0 degrees solid to 0 degrees liquid) and to heat water (from 0 degrees liquid to 70 degrees liquid).
1. Too cold and there is no snowball, because you need the moisture.
1. ["A modern samarium-cobalt magnet takes around 700 years to lose half its strength."](http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/do-magnets-wear-out)
1. E162 [Betanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betanin) aka Beetroot red is the name of the red food dye. Betanin degrades when subjected to light, heat, and oxygen.
1. Iridium is also the third least abundant rare earth element, so anything with iridium implies it being expensive.
1. Some organic samples must be coated in gold before an electron microscope could image them: "the electron microscope is only capable of producing topographies of conductive materials, such as metals"
1. The phytohemagglutinin in as few as 25 unsoaked kidney Beans can kill you. If they are slow cooked, the toxicity increases fivefold.
1. Chloroform won't knock someone out in seconds. It takes minutes.
1. The [Bohr Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_effect) explains why increasing CO2 concentration makes hemoglobin release their oxygen (affinity curve).
