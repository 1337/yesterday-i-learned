1. [TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene) is not [trinitroglycerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin), which can be made by slowly adding 1:1 HNO3/H2SO4 into cold glycerol. The HNO3/H2SO4 process is done twice for TNT, plus an extra nitration step using HNO3 and oleum (apparently).
1. Whatever you used to call "precipitate out", apparently professional chemists just call "crash out". It involves making a soluble compound insoluble by, well, changing the solubility of the solvent.
1. Only elements lighter than iron can be used for [nuclear fusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy#/media/File%3ABinding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg) and still yield energy.
1. [Dishwasher detergents do not foam up inside the dishwasher.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5j08ot/how_do_suds_bubbles_influence_a_soapdetergents/)
1. "Cultured celery extract" is marketing's way of saying (sodium) nitrite, a cancerous food preservative.
1. Opoids cause constipation.
1. Epsom salt in a bath does nothing medically beneficial. It is also impossible to get too much magnesium from epsom salt baths. People go into saturated magnesium sulphate baths in isolation tanks all the time, and none of them were poisoned by it.
1. It is possible to ["accidentally make an explosive"](http://epigram.org.uk/news/2017/02/41190), [TATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone_peroxide), by mixing acetone and hydrogen peroxide. *Wolffenstein combined acetone and hydrogen peroxide, and then he allowed the mixture to stand for a week at room temperature, during which time a small quantity of crystals precipitated*. The resulting powder is [fairly useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEdnNOi6DS4).
1. [Mineral wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool) is a bunch of mineral fibres spun together.
1. Biodiesel came from used cooking oil and cow hide processing. Proponents say biodiesel contains less cancer-causing particles.
1. Drinking wine for antioxidants because it prevents cancer, ignoring the fact that alcohol is a top-notch carcinogen, is human stupidity.
1. [Naltrexone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone), more or less an u-opioid blocker, might cure alcoholism by never allowing a buzz, provided it was ingested immediately before a drink, not daily.
1. Nair's active ingredients are calcium hydroxide (lime) and sodium hydroxide (lye).
1. According to Wolfram Alpha, [one drop of water is 50 ÂµL](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+one+drop+of+water).
1. [Enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel), the hardest material produced by humans, is only 5 on the hardness scale, yet *still* cracks.
1. Zinc is a powerful lewis acid (electron [pair] acceptor). [Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc#cite_note-215)
1. DEET is a solvent. It should not be used on plastics and painted surfaces.
1. In zinc batteries, [the housing is the anode.](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-zinc-and-alkaline/) This means the housing is consumed when the battery is used, making it more prone to leakage.
1. [Putrescine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrescine), apart from making up the smell of dead flesh, also contributes to smells like bad breath, bacterial vaginosis, and semen.
