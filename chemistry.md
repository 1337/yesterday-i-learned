1. [Keto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautomer) form is the one with a ketone group; Enol form is the one with that ketone group reduced to an alcohol group, but a nearby C-C sigma bond hybridising with a pi (aka double bond). [Keto-enol tautomerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keto%E2%80%93enol_tautomerism) occurs in aqueous solutions only (faster if either acidic or basic).
1. When cereal makers say they add iron to it, [they actually add solid Fe-0](http://littleshop.physics.colostate.edu/Try%20At%20Home/IronCereal.htm). Not even oxide, just iron.
1. Replacing BPA with [BPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_F) or [BPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_S) (i.e. "BPA-free") is [not that great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuMGc0EswTc&feature=youtu.be). BPF/BPS can alter testosterone levels.
1. [Cobalt-chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt-chrome) is an alloy made with cobalt and chrome.
1.[Pop fizzes more when you shake it](https://www.scienceabc.com/pure-sciences/why-a-soft-drink-bottle-fizzes-when-opened.html) as a direct consequence of you adding energy into the bottle by shaking it. More energy upsets the equilibrium, giving trapped gas enough energy to break surface tension, forming bubbles.
1. [The mint lifesaver glows in the dark when bitten into.](http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question505.htm) "Actually, all hard sugar-based candies emit some degree of light when you bite them, but most of the time, that light is very faint." Crystalline sugar emits energy as UV light when crushed, and the methyl salicylate in that mint absorbs UV light and emits visible light.
1. [TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene) is not [trinitroglycerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin), which can be made by slowly adding 1:1 HNO3/H2SO4 into cold glycerol. The HNO3/H2SO4 process is done twice for TNT, plus an extra nitration step using HNO3 and oleum (apparently).
1. Whatever you used to call "precipitate out", apparently professional chemists just call "crash out". It involves making a soluble compound insoluble by, well, changing the solubility of the solvent.
1. Only elements lighter than iron can be used for [nuclear fusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy#/media/File%3ABinding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg) and still yield energy.
1. [Dishwasher detergents do not foam up inside the dishwasher.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5j08ot/how_do_suds_bubbles_influence_a_soapdetergents/)
1. "Cultured celery extract" is marketing's way of saying (sodium) nitrite, a cancerous food preservative.
1. Opoids cause constipation.
1. Epsom salt in a bath does nothing medically beneficial. It is also impossible to get too much magnesium from epsom salt baths. People go into saturated magnesium sulphate baths in isolation tanks all the time, and none of them were poisoned by it.
1. It is possible to ["accidentally make an explosive"](http://epigram.org.uk/news/2017/02/41190), [TATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone_peroxide), by mixing acetone and hydrogen peroxide. *Wolffenstein combined acetone and hydrogen peroxide, and then he allowed the mixture to stand for a week at room temperature, during which time a small quantity of crystals precipitated*. The resulting powder is [fairly useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEdnNOi6DS4).
1. [Mineral wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool) is a bunch of mineral fibres spun together.
1. Biodiesel came from used cooking oil and cow hide processing. Proponents say biodiesel contains less cancer-causing particles.
1. Drinking wine for antioxidants because it prevents cancer, ignoring the fact that alcohol is a top-notch carcinogen, is human stupidity.
1. [Naltrexone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone), more or less an u-opioid blocker, might cure alcoholism by never allowing a buzz, provided it was ingested immediately before a drink, not daily.
1. Nair's active ingredients are calcium hydroxide (lime) and sodium hydroxide (lye).
1. According to Wolfram Alpha, [one drop of water is 50 ÂµL](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+one+drop+of+water).
1. [Enamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel), the hardest material produced by humans, is only 5 on the hardness scale, yet *still* cracks.
1. Zinc is a powerful lewis acid (electron [pair] acceptor). [Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc#cite_note-215)
1. DEET is a solvent. It should not be used on plastics and painted surfaces.
1. In zinc batteries, [the housing is the anode.](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-zinc-and-alkaline/) This means the housing is consumed when the battery is used, making it more prone to leakage.
1. [Putrescine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrescine), apart from making up the smell of dead flesh, also contributes to smells like bad breath, bacterial vaginosis, and semen.
1. "[Cocaethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaethylene)" is formed by the liver when cocaine and ethanol coexist in the blood. Apparently it ... carries an 18- to 25-fold increase over cocaine alone in risk of immediate death. Or, if you are an optimist, you may find your chance of dying from cocaine alone at most 1/18 as likely as this cocaethylene thing.
1. [/u/SimplyOriginal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/2quas2/weed_as_a_party_drug/cn9ncl8/) posts about maximising alcohol's per-unit potential: *Eat [fatty foods and carbs] 45mins before your first drink [to] slow down the absorption rate. Maintain a [steady] increase of [BAC]. Stick to one type of alcohol [to maintain the feel-good effects. Do not] hammer shots.*
1. Cocaine stops being detectable in fluids after a few days.
1. Lasers burn away rust, but not with the iron underneath, because rust absorbs more light than iron.
1. (Throwback Wednesday) Buffer solutions can only be made from [weak acids](http://chemcollective.org/activities/tutorials/buffers/buffers3) (and their conjugate bases). When a strong acid is added, the conjugate base neutralises it. When a strong base is added, the acid protonates, neutralising the base. In both cases, the pH did not change much.
1. Aluminium cookware can potentially add [1~2mg](http://www.livestrong.com/article/475155-health-risks-of-cooking-in-aluminum/) of it to your diet per day. The upper limit is 85mg. Better safe than sorry.
1. The [pH of urine](https://www.rnceus.com/ua/uaph.html) can vary wildly from 4.5 to 8. It correlates to whatever pH your body is, which can be low (dehydration) or high (crazy illnesses, see link).
1. [Oxalic acid](https://www.livescience.com/56237-why-spinach-makes-teeth-feel-weird.html) is the cause of spinach making your teeth feel funny. Too much (now calcium oxalate) in your kidneys become kidney stones.
1. Henna is light brown. There is no such thing as black henna. [Black henna is P-Phenylenediamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Phenylenediamine), which is a banned skin irritant (for henna).
