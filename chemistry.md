* Whatever you used to call "precipitate out", apparently professional chemists just call "crash out". It involves making a soluble compound insoluble by, well, changing the solubility of the solvent.
* Only elements lighter than iron can be used for [nuclear fusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy#/media/File%3ABinding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg) and still yield energy.
* [Dishwasher detergents do not foam up inside the dishwasher.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5j08ot/how_do_suds_bubbles_influence_a_soapdetergents/)
* "Cultured celery extract" is marketing's way of saying (sodium) nitrite, a cancerous food preservative.
* Opoids cause constipation.
* Epsom salt in a bath does nothing medically beneficial. It is also impossible to get too much magnesium from epsom salt baths. People go into saturated magnesium sulphate baths in isolation tanks all the time, and none of them were poisoned by it.
* It is possible to ["accidentally make an explosive"](http://epigram.org.uk/news/2017/02/41190), [TATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone_peroxide), by mixing acetone and hydrogen peroxide. *Wolffenstein combined acetone and hydrogen peroxide, and then he allowed the mixture to stand for a week at room temperature, during which time a small quantity of crystals precipitated*. The resulting powder is [fairly useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEdnNOi6DS4).
